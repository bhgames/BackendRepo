		/* (firepower, ammo, accuracy) - remember two tier 1's should be able to kill another soldier.
		 * Tier 1: (Costs only one weapons slot)
		 * Pump-Action EMP Burster - Fires short range, wide burst EMP pulses to deactivate other soldiers.
		 * Pulverizer - Fires medium range heavy radiation beams.
		 * Plasma Rifle - Fires automatic directed globs of liquid plasma, great for all situations.
		 * Rail Gun - Fires heavy steel projectiles, extremely accurate! 
		 * Laser Rifle - Extremely accurate, semi-auto laser rifle
		 * Arc-Thrower - Looks like a bow, but made of fine steel and complicated circuitry..
		 * Instead of a bowstring, there is an arc of electricity.
		 * The user can swing the bow in a direction and the electromagnetic energy in the "bowstring" will fling off
		 * towards a target and fry their circuits.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Tier 2: (Costs two weapons slots)
		 * WTF Class Rocket Launcher - Fires a giant rocket at something unfriendly. (70,1,25)
		 * Automatic EMP Burster - Fires short range, wide burst EMP pulses without all the pumping. (12,5,45)
		 * Plasma Minigun - Fires an entire clip of plasma in less than one second. Aim away from face. (2,25,65)
		 * Gauss Cannon - Like a rail gun, only less friendly and a lot larger. (15,3,75)
		 * Fully Automated Laser Drone - Can be attached to the back of the soldier and will fire automatically with nearly perfect
		 * accuracy. (40,1,100) 
		 * Moles - Thrown as a single grenade, five tiny robots launch out of the central stalk of the grenade using
		 * it's explosive force and burrow into the nearest
		 * enemy, going straight for electronic components.
		 * EMP Grenade Launcher - No description required.
		 * Auto-targeting Laser Rifle - as accurate as a laser rifle, but fully automatic, with an auto-targeting feature for
		 * high FPS.
		 * Missile Launcher - Packs less punch than a single-fire Rocket Launcher, since it has many miniature
		 * rockets packed into a single square grid located on the front of the device. Better chance of hitting your target, though.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Tier 3: (Costs four weapons slots)
		 * BRTHLE - Nobody has lived to tell what is inside the simple 3ft by 3ft square. Soldiers
		 * set it down and press a red button atop it and run as fast as they can in the other direction. No remains of
		 * soldiers are ever found, they are simply wiped from the face of the Universe, with the box.(160,1,60)
		 * 
		 * Singularity Whip - A whip that flings miniature black holes at enemies. (70,2,75)
		 * 
		 * Gauss Minigun with Antigravity - Fully automatic Gauss minigun with Antigravity support for easy transport. (1,120,85)
		 * 
		 * Quantum Anomaly Enabler (QAE) - Seeks out quantum fluctuations in the air near enemies and enlarges them with
		 * gravitational waves emitted at quantum resonance frequencies. Causes instant liquidation. (50,2,95)
		 * 
		 * Superstring Accelerator Rifle - Fires a fundamental piece of the early universe less than a planck length across
		 * with an accuracy verging on the uncertainty limit at a speed near that of light itself. (90,1,120)
		 * 
		 * Mass-To-Energy Converter (MEC) - Fires a piece of antimatter that turns any matter it touches into pure energy.
		 * 
		 * EMP Wasp - A small flying robot that lands on an enemy soldier, takes over his subsystems, and causes him to turn
		 * towards his nearest ally and emit an EMP burst in that direction, as well as emptying whatever gun he is carrying.
		 * 
		 * The Kingmaker - Fires a miniature neutron bomb that explodes with a radius of about one hundred meters, annihilating
		 * all organic material within.
		 * 
		 * Wrath - A cyber-warfare program integrated into the unit that disables other units by inducing suicidal thoughts via
		 * electromagnetic interference. As this has no actual picture, we should instead draw a picture of a man with his hands
		 * on his head in great pain.
		 * 
		 * Tier four weapons(1 weapons slot, can only be equipped with bombers):
		 * The Horizon Machine and the Focused Nova Bomb kill people - the Nova Bomb should be as powerful as a tier 3 weapon, the
		 * HM as powerful as a tier 2.
		 * 
		 *The Horizon Machine - A type of bomb that doesn't explode, but implodes into a tiny singularity
		 * with an event horizon about the size of a city block. It evaporates after a millisecond, 
		 * taking everything within the horizon with it.
		 * 
		 *Focused Nova Bomb - Within the machinations of a sphere one hundred feet wide, a star is born, and then it
		 *dies, brilliantly, violently. All of the gamma radiation from this fiery death is thrust out in one direction -
		 *down. Every citizen caught in it's rush is immediately deactivated. Kills people
