			"<br />As you can see from your I/O box, which we've opened for you beneath this Quest Box when you close it, an attack is incoming from an Id town, but you've prepared for it! Unfortunately, you cannot smack talk your victory to Id, because Id is the umbrella name for all unoccupied cities and the now-defunct A.I. that once controlled them. Each unoccupied city is an uncivilized place of maddened robots that occasionally lash out at nearby players, like this Id town is now. They are also havens of new resources and technologies.<br /><br /> While you're busily defending yourself, you should build a bunker. Bunkers serve as defensive barriers – whether they protect resources, soldiers, or civilians, depending on your choice from the Bunker menu. Women and children first...or weapons? It's up to you!<br /><br />Also, you've picked up a distress call from a nearby city. It seems to have something to do with Learning Java. You have the option to leave it alone or to check it out. To investigate it, choose the BQBranchToRQ Quest from the Quest menu.<br /><br /> Goal: Survive the battle and build a bunker.<br /><br />"+getRewardBlock(2,pid,additional)
