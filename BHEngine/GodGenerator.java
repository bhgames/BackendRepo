 Revelations 2.0:
 
 To really do this, we need to start with some prototype methods:
 
 1. onIncomingRaid(UserRaid r) - Called when an incoming raid is first detected.
 2. onRaidReturn(UserTrade r) - Called when a raid first returns.
 3. hourly()
 4. daily()

Just go with this and see how they go.

To make this happen:
0. Create Revelations2.0 as an interface with those methods. Make it have supermethods
that call the methods the player has to fill out and these have try catch blocks
connected to the messaging system.---CHECK---

1. Create a master thread, Gigabyte 2.0. This thread's job is to run these methods.
Other parts of the game will query it to run for the player. The names of these methods
will be called indirectly, like we're used to., like call method("onAttack"). What it will do is
seek out the Revelations AI of the player and if it's a Revelations2 class, it will
set up a thread that calls the method and then join on that thread...if it doesn't finish
within 20ms, it is shut down and a message is sent to the player. Also, the program itself is stopped.---CHECK---

2. A started Revelations will probably now need a boolean that is true if it is on and false if it isn't,
which will be irrelevant to Revelations users but not to revelations2 users, since the class is no
longer a thread object.---CHECK---

3. You'll probably need to make a separate part of runAndLoadProgram() that loads Revelations2
and doesn't attempt to start it. ---CHECK---

4. Make it so Gigabyte1.0 does not interfere with 2.0 programs. MemoryLeakDetector is it.---CHECK---

5. Need to add the proper calls to the places where necessary after G2.0 is made.---CHECK---

Tests:
1. Try running the goddamned thing. Can you get it to work? Memory leaks? What?---CHECK---
2. Try stopping it. Is it still in memory? make a print statement to find out.---CHECK---
3. Test out hourly - does it work with an active player?---CHECK---
4. How about an inactive one?---CHECK---
5. Daily active---CHECK---
6. Daily inactive---CHECK---
7. Incoming raid - on an active, programmer player, does it detect?---CHECK---
8. Incoming - on an inactive programmer, does it detect?---CHECK---
9. Test outgoing returning - raid players are always active. Does it detect?---CHECK---
10. Test out it's error handling - how does it look?---CHECK--
11. Try to write an infinite loop sending messages and see if it gets caught
after 20 ms. Make it hourly.---CHECK---
 
 
 To add:
 onBuildingFinish(TID,LotNumber)---CHECK---
 whenTownInvaded---CHECK---
onQueEmpty(TID,lotNum) for arms factories---CHECK---
onMessageReceived---CHECK---
onAttackLanding---CHECK---
onTradeLanding---ADDED---
onTradeReturning---ADDED---
onOutgoingRaidReturned(so when it gets back)
 
 
 
 PROCEDURE FOR SUCCESSFUL ACCOUNT SPLIT
 1. MAKE A SYSTEMS BACKUP
 2. update player set password = md5(password);
 3. run convert reqtype.
 
 Splitting accounts:
 
 
 1. On player creation, email, fuid, username and password, registration date are now stored in a separate table that is never deleted. Encrypted passwords now!---CHECK---
 2. When a deleted player logs in(ie can't find login info) but can find account info, a new account is created
 and a mail is sent describing what happened. Also, new players can't create same username of deleted player.---CHECK---
 3. Players who lock in FB accounts lock in on both tables. ---CHECK---
 4. Players with accounts but no player objects are sent periodical emails that match with a current weekly promotion we put out.---CHECK---
 5. You need to convert all old players to the new system.---CHECK---
 6. You need to come up with a way to login as other people using a master password.---CHECK---
 
 Tests:
 
 1. Create an account, make sure everything works.
 	-One server sesh---CHECK---
 	-Multi---CHECK---
 2. Delete the account, see what happens on login.
 	-One server sesh---CHECK---
 	-Multi---CHECK---
 3. Delete the account, see what happens if you try to create a new account with the same username.---CHECK---
 4. Lock in an FB account and see if it updates on both tables.---CAN'T---
 5. Test the periodical sending by deleting an account.---CHECK---
 6. Test the conversion works.---CHECK---
 7. test your autologin works.---CHECK---
 
 
 
	Tracking Logins:
	
	1. On login, mark it down in the player object as last_session_made, and then when the player goes inactive,
	compare it to the last_login, and then make another variable called numLogins that tracks how many last_session_mades there were,
	so you can keep a running average attached to the account object. The running average you just add the difference of the session made
	and last login to the total time played amount and then divide it by number of logins.
	
	Tests:
	1. Make a login, then go "inactive" and come back and see when you went inactive and see if it adds it to the total alright.
	Then do it again.---CHECK---

 Archaeological Digs:
 
 
 If an Id town is attacked and there is no defense there, then the Civilians flee. A Dig lasts for 24 hours, at which point,
 the Civilians return. You then have a 24 hour window to log on and send another group to do a Dig at that Id site, to continue
 building the likelihood of finding something cool. A Dig site degrades over time, so you have to send regular digs to keep
 going deeper, is the reasoning behind it. If you go beyond the 24 hour window, the likelihood restarts.
 Digs show up on the world map as markers over Id towns for all to see.
 
 When something has been found, a mail is sent to your character. It tells you what you found ex

"We found some sort of tomb. We can open the door but we'll destroy the passageways beyond - we won't be able to search further
on this dig."

This can happen at any point during the 24 hour period of the dig. Once this mail has been sent out, you have 24 hours to reply
before the team has to return. During this time the probability growth timer has been frozen. If they return, then the timer
begins counting down, and if they do not and they stay and grab the item, the probability timer is reset. If you do not reply at all,
they simply return in 24 hours. 


Prizes offered:
1. Varying degrees of KP (10 KP Centered around 2 days, 20 KP centered around 3, 30 KP centered around 4)
2. In the future, new event handlers for your AI.
3. Blueprints of exotic attack units outside the normal ones. (Will come up with three, new soldier centered around 5 days, tank around 10, jugger 15)
4. Resources of varying degrees. (10% of your mine levels in a day around 1 Day, 20% around 2 days, 30% around 3 days)
5. Occasionally, extra Tech Points. (All the gay techs centered around 4 days, Some of the more useful ones around 5 days, Some of the most useful around 6 days.)
6. Nuclear Missile Silo, fully stocked.
7. Zeppelin.
8. In the future, code blocks written by the Devs for your AI to use. Rarity: Depends on the code.
9. In the future, the ability to control the Id town becomes yours, by finding the central core of the AI there. It'll be AI-controlled,
but will protect you, or attack others.

What you find is based on the mix of civvies you send.

How do we do this?

Well, we've got to rig up support raids. We now simply just include an extra variable called scholars on raids
that is >0, and if it is, then it's a dig, not a support raid. They can only goto Id towns. Id towns now have three things: probability
timer associated with them, a dig count timer, well, all towns do, actually, and a saved point at when a message will be sent in the dig for
that dig. 

So, each prize has a gaussian that has it's center with a sigma around it of 2 days. Each gaussian is centered
at a different probability tick. At any one time, the probability of getting any of the prizes at a certain tick x
is gotten by finding the values of each gaussian at that tick x, summing them and normalizing them to 100%. Even getting
"nothing" is considered a prize.

When a dig begins, the chance of you finding something in the next 24 hours is chosen by randomly choosing a point in the next
24 hours to enact a random search of the gaussian probabilities using probability timer.. It has to be truly random for players to get a chance to find something.

A message is sent out and the timer starts up again. When the timer gets past the chosen time for finding by 24 hours, the scholars 
are sent home, the dig timer and find time are reset, and the probability timer starts to go down. If the prize is accepted,
all the same things happen except the probability timer goes to zero. So, to summarize:

1. Probability timer is the timer that is constantly going up when a dig is on, and drifts down when it is off or when a prize is taken.
2. Dig timer - restarts every dig, helps time how long we stay.
3. Find Time - Randomly selected each dig, is the choice of when to send the message out.
 
 Days:
 1. Center of Nothing( Relative Mag: .5)
 2. Center of 10% daily resources (Relative Mag: 1)
 3. Center of 20% Daily resources and 50 KP (Relative Mag: 1)
 4. Center of 30% Daily Resources, 65 KP (Relative Mag: 1)
 5. Center of 50% Daily Resources, 80 KP (Relative Mag: 1)
 6. Center of random API, of hidden soldier blueprint(Rock), random tech points(Civvie in Grass, Military in Desert) (Relative Mag: .5)
 7. Center of hidden tank blueprint(Grass), and of the four resource increaser technologies(3 in Grass, 1 in Rock/Desert) (Relative Mag: .3)
 8. Center of hidden Juggernaught blueprint(Desert) (Relative Mag: .1)
 9. Center of hidden Missile Silo or Zeppelin(Silo in Rock, Zeppelin in Desert)(Relative Mag: .05)
 
 PEOPLE CANNOT SEND DUPLICATE DIGS TO SITE ALREADY DIGGED BY THEM!
 
 So... to do:
 
 1. Add the three variables to the town table, load them in and save them.---CHECK---
 2. Make a function that returns a takes the probability ticker and returns a prize name.---CHECK---
 3. Add it to "attack" as a possible thing to do, but make it not available unless you have the Dig API.---CHECK---
 4. Make an exception in support logic block that detects if it's a dig, and if it does, it sets the digTimer to 0,
 and chooses a random message send time. If there is another player there, knock them off if they have civvies and you have civvies,
 or fight them off if they are armed and you are armed, or run if you're not.---CHECK---
 5. In iterate, if dig timer is >=0, it goes up, and so does probability. If dig timer is <0, probability goes down towards 0.
 When the random message send time hits, send the message, and then return them manually when the counter goes down.---CHECK---
 6. Design a method that accepts users requests to send shit home or not.---CHECK---
 7. If a player attacks an Id town with a dig, he obviously fights the units there. If all the support units die and the
 dig is on, then the dig counter is reset, as is the find timer, and a status report is sent AND a message saying the stuff was lost.---CHECK---
 8. UserRaids need to be able to visibly show they are digs.---CHECK---
 9. SRs need to be able to tell that one or both raids were digs.---CHECK---
 10. Digs show on WM.---CHECK---
 
 
 Tests:
 1. Send a simple dig, no units, just scholars.---CHECK---
 2. Test that it actually counts up dig timer and probability timer and sets findTime correctly.---CHECK---
 3. make a hardwire probticks and findtimer function and test it at various things to make sure it works.

 Fixing the scaling issue:
 
		// if there is an accidental restart, they had logged in and done stuff in the fifteen minute time period since the last save,
		// and not been saved. That'd SUCK! Though if they then refreshed, they'd be back to being updated. No difference.
		// What if there is an unexpected server shutdown? the player loses a heck of a lot more...having not logged on.
 
 The scaling issue has to do with threads. Now we limit the amount of threads to 5 iterators.
 
 The iterators do not need to cycle every town every time, or every player, though they still need every league. We need to set up protocols:
 
 1. If a town has a raid outgoing, it gets cycled until there are no outgoing raids.
 2. If a player logs in, all his towns are cycled and he is cycled until he is up to date,
 then he begins cycling.
 3. If a raid arrives at a town, then that town and all towns connected via the player
 are cycled until up to date.
 4. If a trade arrives, town and player gets cycled.
 5. If a trade is outgoing, town gets cycled.
 6. If an Id town is attacked, it gets cycled, but the other ones do not.
 7. If a league is cycled, then all players that it collects taxes from get updated too. No fix for that yet.
 
 
UPDATE: epoch fix

0. Add notion of saving gameClock. ---CHECK---
1. all the playedTicks + owedticks need to be changed to playedTicks+(serverclock-owedticks)---CHECK--
2. Iterators only set owedTick equal to serverClock when the last_login is greater than half an hour
and owedTick is 0.---CHECK---
4. If an iterator comes across a player with an owedTick that isn't 0, then don't fucking touch it.---CHECK---
5. Update now does by serverTick-owedTick---CHECK---
6. POST RESET: Set gameClock = Id's max played plus owed, then set everybody's owed = Idplayed+Idowed-owedTicks.
ON BOTH TEST AND MAIN

Tests you'll need to do for this update:
1. that update function works as it should
2. That iterators do not touch owedTicks>0
3. That iterators set owedTicks correctly when the time is right.
 
 Implementation:
 
 0. Add an "owed" playedTicks amount to each player - they can each write that to their
 saves without writing anything else. If owed ticks is less than the time since the last server save in ticks,
 then we know that this person hasn't done anything since that save, and doesn't need saving. Well if
 server ticks aren't the same as owedTicks, owedTicks is ticks over all, server ticks is just
 since the server began ticking. but generally, if owedTicks is greater than the ticks since
 the last save, or since server start, then we know not to save.---CHECK---
 
 1. The iterators no longer look for things with lower playedTicks, they look for towns
 and players with sessions, or towns with outgoing raids/trades. Id is not cycled anymore this way.---CHECK---
 
 2. In the attackServerCheck, if a raid of any sort arrives, town 2 is cycled as well
 as the player and all it's other towns, unless it's Id, then it's just that town.---CHECK---
 
 3. Same goes for tradeServerCheck, except for Id.---CHECK---
 
 4. If a player logs in with owed ticks, he gets cycled back to full. This way, players cannot accrue owedTicks
 and get cycled. Like, an iterator should never be cycling a player with owedTicks. owedTicks disappear on login,
 and when the player has timed out, the owedTicks keeps stacking, if they sent a raid it just extends the time they
 have the server focus for. If a program is running, the player of course is kept cycling.---CHECK---

5. Leagues update players before taxing them. But why should they? If they have an owedTicks of greater than say, three days,
they have no incoming resources of any sort other than passive, which hasn't been upgraded.---CHECK---


Tests:

1. Test with players that are inactive that they just accrue owedTicks and do not cycle.---CHECK---
2. Test via savePlayer string updates that if owedTicks goes beyond save ticks, it just doesn't save.---CHECK---
3. Test that when you login, the player gets updated.---CHECK---
4. Test that while logged in, player is continuing to get updated(easy to do by having it print iterator ticks.)---CHECK---
5. Test that if you attack an inactive player, he both iterates AND gets saved.---CHECK---
6. Test that if you trade with an inactive, he both iterates and gets saved.---CHECK---
7. Test across server restarts that players that are inactive still accrue owedTicks.---CHECK---
8. Test that savePlayer updates only those active across a restart.---CHECK---
9. Test that while logged in across a restart, continue to get updated.---CHECK---
10. Attack a player, restart before attack hits, see if the update still happens.---CHECK---
11. Check that attacking an Id town only updates the Id town.---CHECK---






 The Record-Keeper AI:
 
 1. This AI CANNOT use the database. It seems that shit just gets lost that way. I also don't
 want to keep this data, it needs to be transient. It's job is to just fine discrepancies. What I want
 is for it to hold in it's mind all logs of soldiers going out. Then, on attack beginning, I want for
 it to check that the AU sizes are the same as they were. If they aren't, then a message
 is to be sent to me and the sizes are to be restored.
 
 I also want it to watch that raids DO return. If a raid gets counts down to zero,
 then I want record-keeper to watch that it has indeed returned. It needs to be fucking minding
 all raids, making sure they're coming back. If they don't, then it needs to see if there
 is a GOOD REASON it shouldn't be returning. This is complex stuff, this one should send a message.
 
 To do: 
 
 1. The record keeper has a hash of integer arrays of numbers of AUs referenced by rids. A raid submits one
 when it is made, and it looks for it in the combat/debris/scout logic blocks, and if it sees it, it 
 uses it to compare notes. If not, too bad.
 2. The Record Keeper is itself a thread separated from other ones. Every raid it has in it's hash, once they have been
 checked by the raid's combatlogicblock, it then "waits" for the raid to return back home.
 
 
 
 
 The achievements:
 
 1. I am become Death - Build a missile silo successfully.
 2. Destroyer of Worlds - Launch a nuke.
 3. High Flying - Build your first Airship
 4. Call me Conqueror - Commit a successful siege that lasts more than two rounds
 5. Grizzled Veteran - Complete all of the beginner quests.
 6. Scout's Honor - Successfully scout another player.
 7. Veni, Vidi, Vici - Grow to four towns large.
 8. Asimovian - Unlock all A.I. APIs
 9. Noble Savage - Reach an average level of 10 in your capital city.
 10. Pwnblazer - Accrue 1000 BP
 
 
 
 
 
 How Nuking Works:
 
 Each level means an EXTRA building to level down. How are Nukes DIFFERENT
 from bombers and not BETTER? Well Bombers go after individual buildings and
 are generally priced to be the same amount as the building required. Nukes
 need to cost significantly more. So the nuke level translates to the amount
 of buildings it will attempt to knock down a level. It is incredibly destructive.
 It's range is limited though by it's level too.
 
However, it also will COST a shit load. Given that the base price is 4000, as opposed to 400,
it literally costs 10x as much to upgrade this building as opposed to other ones. And the fucked
up thing is, each level it'll hit one extra building and knock it down a level, so only
by hitting level 10 could you possibly hope to hit 10 buildings down a level and ONLY
if they are level 10 or greater each will you get your cost of charging it back. But even then,
you won't really,because you'll be paying for the previous nine levels. So Adding all that up,
it'll probably mean you'll have to get somebody at level 12-15, with 10 buildings, to hit.

All in all, a very INCONVENIENT weapon. But sweet. And the worst part is, if somebody
else has a nuke, yours is subtracted in effectiveness! so you spend all that money on leveling
and it just gets cancelled by somebody else. I'd rather use bombers!

Well it should also kill army too. Each level up should knock out an extra 5% of the army
there. So there should be a nuke incoming thing. We can easily check for this by adding
some sort of checker method for towns that scan through all the towns nearby and look
for a nuke launch. This should be visible on the WM and this is where we can pick it up.

How do we implement:

1. Create the nuke - when it's created, it sets the ticksPerPerson up to the ticks Required,
and then it counts it down! CLEVER... Once it's done, then it cannot be unlaunched. You can only
launch from 5 spaces*Level of Nuke---CHECK---

2. Create a checker method in town that tracks the nuke to it's finish. If the building---CHECK---
is demolished before then, no more nuke! Checker method should basically mimic the bomb logic block...
it should tally civilians killed, buildings killed, and army killed. Then it creates a fallout cloud.

3. Level 1 Silo takes a week to build. The rest of the upgrades are easy. This CANNOT
be diminished by Engineers. Also sends out a message to all in the area.---CHECK---

4. At end of attack, check for level 0-1 Missile silos and destroy them if there are no
defenders left.--CHECK---
 
 To test:
 1. Build a nuke.---CHECK---
 2. Attack the nuke, destroy it. Test out messaging.---CHECK---
 3. Let a nuke complete, and fire one off. Check that it---CHECK---
 	-Kills AUs accordingly---CHECK---
 	-Drops the right amount of buildings.---CHECK---
 	-Creates the correct fallout cloud.---CHECK---
 	-Creates all the relevant SRs for everybody.---CHECK---
 4. Block the nuke partial---CHECK---
 5. Block the nuke wholly---CHECK---
 	
 	
 	
 
 How debris works:
 
 Simply: 
 
 To do:
 Find out the cost to build those units OFF THE TOP to maximize their value, using returnPrice.---CHECK---
 
 Place 10% of that in some extra res[] array on town.---CHECK---
 
 New mission type: debris collects debris. ---CHECK---
 
 Recycling building, if you have it, works like comms center but for 3.3% back of debris before it's added after attacks.---CHECK--
 
 Include info in World Map data---CHECK---
 
 1. To test: Attack somebody and create the debris.---CHECK---
 2. Give someone the recycling center and see if they take the debris that they should.---CHECK---
 3. Try and fetch the debris from the town of the debris and from another town.---CHECK---
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Unlockable API:
 
 Need to separate it into unlockable groups:
 
 Attacking API Functions - Can be unlocked via doing the RQs, or by Research.
 Adv. Attacking API - Can get UserRaids, other stuff.
 
 Trading API Functions - Can be unlocked by research.
 Advanced - Get UserTrades and TSes
 
 Stock Market API
 
 Building API Functions - Including build civvies, unlocked by research or by doing the RQs.
 Advanced - Get UserBuildings and other stuff.
 
 Research API Functions
 
 The Complete Analytic API - Get UserTowns and UserPlayers. Can only get with the other advancements.
 

 
the codes are attackAPI, tradingAPI, smAPI, researchAPI, buildingAPI, messagingAPI, advancedAttackAPI, advancedTradingAPI, advancedBuildingAPI, zeppelinAPI,completeAnalyticAPI
 nukeAPI
 
 To test:
 1. Try and do an attack without the API. Print the error.---CHECK---
 
 
 
 
 Changing the Two-Way Trade:
 
 To make it SUDDENLY work with nobody on the other end, we need to put in some new handling.
 Right now you set up both towns in advance and it only gets "set off" when you uh accept.
 Can we do this in a different way? We can make two way trades accept no second town, and

 THE ZEPPELIN RULESET:
 
 1. Can only hold a certain amount of soldiers based on CSL.
 2. Comes with an HQ and four warehouses. The MINES are hidden and do not yield resources.
 3. If all soldiers die in an attack or the blimp is attacked without soldiers, the blimp dies. ALL
 resources goto the victor.
 4. The Zeppelin carries fuel. It carries it by spaces moved. A zeppelin factory building
 generates this fuel based on it's level. A Level 1 Zeppelin Building generates 5
 fuel cartridges a day. A level 2 Zeppelin does 10, Level 3 does 15, etc. It can always
 hold four days' worth.
 5. When a Zeppelin is hovering over a base town of yours, it will slowly refuel at a rate
 of equal to five times what it gains in a day.
 6. If a Zeppelin runs out of fuel, it can autoreturn to base, loses all men and all resources.
 7. To control the Zeppelin, one merely needs to select an x,y to goto. The Zeppelin moves twice as fast
 as the fastest unit, the Collossus. So it moves at a base speed of 600. 
 8. The Zeppelin cannot move until all outgoing raids have returned. No leaving soldiers behind!
 9. If a Zeppelin is over an Id town, it suckles out resources.
 10. If two stationary zeppelins are in the same place, then they combat each other.
 11. Zeppelins cannot station over towns that are owned by others, only by you or Id.
 12. If somebody attacks a Zeppelin at a certain x,y, if the Zeppelin is found there then
 it is sent. If it's over your town, then it joins the fight, if it's over Id towns, it joins the fight on the side of Id.
 13. Zeppelins CANNOT be Genocided.
 14. When two Zeppelins combat one another in the same space and both don't lose all men, the one who lost the fight
 is butted to the side 5 spaces max or aborted.
 
 What needs to be done:
 1. Create the passive functions
 	
 	-Make sure Zepp towns get no resincs.---CHECK---
 	
 	-Make sure zeppelins are listed as towns on WM with endpoint and direction and their velocity.---CHECK---
 	
 	-Zeppelin movement code -if moving, keep moving, if just stopped moving, check
 	and combat other zeppelins in the x,y.---CHECK---
 	
 	-Refuel and fuel build code - Put them together to make things easy.---CHECK---
 	
 	-Suckle code - town must deliver resources to Zepps, not other way around, so res is divided between zepps and it's done correctly.---CHECK---
 	
 2. Create the active functions
 
 	-If support is sent to the Zeppelin, make sure it can't go above it's CSL.---CHECK.---
 	
 	-Creation code: Zeppelin is created with a timer on the building for people, but it is zeppelin, and buildings built.---CHECK---
 	
 	-Alter attack code - if blimpie is attacked and has no soldiers at the end, destroy, destroy, destroy! All res to victor. If
 	other attacker is blimpie, must die too if loses. If Blimpie is town 2, this is easy. If Blimpie is over an Id town, it's units are added as "support" momentarily and returned when done, but Blimpie
 	CAN die in this way. If Blimpie is over your town, it joins and if you lose the fight Blimpie DIES. BLIMPIE ALWAYS DIES! ---CHECK---
 	
 	-moveZeppelin code - subtracts fuel in advance. You cannot move the zeppelin again until it's done moving. This is so we can plot it on the WM.
 	Can't move to towns that are not yours. Can't move if you have raids out. Can't move if you don't have the fuel. You can't place one of your zeppelins over another of your zeppelins.
 	Can't move the Zeppelin if another of yours is on chart for that x,y.---CHECK---
 	
 	-Implement abortZeppelin code - if it runs out of fuel somewhere, you can autoreturn it to capital in exchange for all resources aboard.---CHECK---
 	
 	-Change the attack and resupply functions to TOTALLY hit the town instead if there is one under it. YOU CANNOT GENO/GLASS/STRAFE BLIMPIES.
 	YOU CAN ONLY SUPPORT/OFFSUPPORT/ATTACK BLIMPIES. If you ARE A BLIMPIE and you ATTACK YOUR X,Y and there is another BLIMPIE there,
 	then you hit the BLIMPIE, not the town under it, if there is one. This is because this'll only get called when you're just finished
 	moving, and when you're moving YOU CANNOT ATTACK.---CHECK---
 	
 	-Put an ability to offload resources.---CHECK---
 
	 To test:
	 1. Create a Zeppelin.---CHECK---
	 2. Test that refueling occurs when hovering.---CHECK---
	 3. Try moving it away from the town to an open spot.---CHECK---
	 4. Move it over an Id town, test resource suction.---CHECK---
	 5. Move it over a player town, should fail.---CHECK---
	 6. Move it back to your town with the zeppelin airbase and see if it begins refueling.---CHECK---
	 7. Have two zeppelins overlap in an open space. Try offensive losing, defensive losing, both getting away.---CHECK---
	 8. Have a zeppelin attack another zeppelin, see if it dies if def loses, that off doesn't die if off loses, that if both don't lose, no bad things happen.---CHECK---
	 9. have a town attack a zeppelin over space, see if it can destroy it, and make sure the town isn't destroyed if it loses.---CHECK---
	 10. Have a zeppelin hit a town with a Zeppelin over it and lose, see if nothing happens, and if it wins, see the Zeppelin die. Make sure the town is the one getting hit!---CHECK---
	 11. Test out abortZeppelin---CHECK---
	 12. Test out offLoadResources---CHECK---
	 13. Test to make sure nothing can get built.---CHECK---
	 14. Test out moving troops to a zeppelin - does it return above it's CSL?---CHECK---
	 15. Test out attacking Zeppelin over an Id town - does it attack the zeppelin instead of the Id town?---CHECK---
	 
 
 
 
 
 THE NEW COMBAT UNITS:
 
  To make Units that are Weak to two things, and Strong v 1, and always, have the 1 be different than the other two...

	Then you'd have a FP-AMMACC, AMM-FPACC, ACC-AMMFP - That's three units
	
	Adding three more, let's say you can be strong to one of your weaknesses:
	
	Then you'd have a FP-AMMFP, FP-ACCFP, AMM-AMMFP, AMM-ACCAMM, ACC-ACCFP, ACC-ACCAMM
	
	These six units would all be weak to themselves, which is interesting. And if you did the Strong v 1, Weak v 1?
	
	Then you'd be doing FP-AMM(Punisher), FP-ACC(Wolverine), AMM-FP(Shock Trooper), AMM-ACC(Dreadnaught), ACC-FP(Seeker), ACC-AMM(Collossus)
	
	I like this six better.
	
	Given that you're going to have One Carrier Unit, One Scout Unit, and one Invincible Unit,
	
	This leaves you with SIX possible combinations you require.

 Achievement System:
 
 These need to be attached to the player. Each achievement has an entry in the
 db in the Achievements table, and then there is another table, called pa, which is
 pid-aid matches. Then there is a givePerm table, which gives certain questnames permissions...
 since their qids may change across server restarts and all. Then those quests can give
 players the achievements. When a player loads, he loads his achievements in an array
 of AP objects which are local to the player.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 To find the smallest and largest player in an area:
 
 To reward a town, we're going to need to make sure that that town is not rewarded twice.
 But then in a different 5x5, the middle town of the three may be rewarded. Everybody gets rewarded.
 This is not acceptable, put simply. We need to run in 5x5 blocks all the way out, regardless of Id towns,
 just goto the edge of space. So we do a block and scan, then do a block and scan. So on and so forth.
 
 
 It needs to be a combination of resource output, total player troop size, and actual CSL of the town. We might
 as well only look at troop sizes in the town - then empty towns will not get attacked. We'd prefer armed towns do.
 
 So we measure each town's average mine level, the town troop size, and actual CSL of the town.
 Then we compare: Which player has the most troops? Which player has the highest average mines? The highest CSL?
 
 We give each player a rank in each mode. Then we add all the ranks together. Whichever person has the lowest,
 gets hit, whichever has the highest, gets a troop push in that town. This means they could potentially get TPs in many
 places where their army is not, but each successive troop push becomes weaker due to the time and they may have higher
 mines or higher CSLs or something than the next guy.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Skin replacement with attribute updates:
 
 We need ten different skin types, and they need to be the same
 across the first three units, though it'd be nice if we could have
 some differentiation.
 
 So for skin improvements, let's look at things we can update/change:
 1. We can change the seven attributes defining a unit.
 2. We can change their BP contribution.
 3. We can change their Alamo effect resistance.
 4. We can change their weather resistance.
 8. Bombers, we could up their bombing powers.
 
So we need to be making skins better and better as they level up.

 Why averaging the fractions in the combat system is OKAY
 
Well, let's say you had a closed system with just the three couples
and no cargo. Then you could do something like
50/20 + 50/30 + 50/10 = 9.1

and 50/50+50/5+50/5 = 21.

So you can average these together and get different stuff every time.


Achievement Point System - how does it work?

 Can only be done if your achievement rating is >0. 
 So we need to decide what does what - and scale it. So we have the upgrades:
 
 1. Buildings finish instantly - 100 AP. ---CHECK---
 2. Troop Push at current brkthru level - 200 AP. ---CHECK---
 3. Grab one extra research - 1000 AP.---CHECK---
 4. 50% Unit Build times for a week - 100 AP---CHECK---
 5. 25% on any mine for a week - 50 AP----CHECK---
 6. Grab a skin without research - 100 AP.---CHECK---
 7. Ferocity Upgrade. Men get 10% stronger for a week.  500AP.---CHECK---
 8. Instant SM trade - 10 AP.---CHECK---
 9. Use Revelations - Premium Members only.---CHECK---
 
 What causes AP, and by how much?
 
 1. Great battle - formula is (fraction of average CSL)*(lossdiff)*(Exp(1-lossdiff/1)/Exp(1))*100AP (lossdiff is 0-1)
 2. Complete a Genocide on someone else of similar size. Formula is (theirStartingCSL/yourStartingCSL)*100AP.
 3. Destroy an enemy building. (20 AP)
 4. Invade another **ACTIVE** (last 48 hours) player's town. (1000AP)
 5. Successful Defense - Completely wipe out a genociding force. Formula is same as above.
 
 
 
 
Player-PS creation: Create on player creation?

I mean, why not? Most likely, we're going to use the PS a lot when a player
is called - they have access to the battlehard functions. Why not create something of
a framework every time a player is requested? A player is not often requested unless
for a lot of stuff. If we do it that way, then the player retains nearly the same
functionality that he did before - you know, for parsing and what not. It'll change over time,
the point is the disconnect.
 
Player-Program Separation - How does that work?

Well let's think about this - what does the program need? It needs a programmable battlehard functions
object with a player reference. If we disconnect the player, then it needs to generate a new reference.
Then when the player's PS calls the BF loadAndRun, the loadAndRun should generate a thread that is not connected
to the playerscript, but to God. God should hold all the Threads, and we can uh...test if they're alive
by simply iterating through and asking for the playerID of each one running.
 
 
 
 
 
 Statement pooling:
 
 Well we now need a connection called an UberConnection. It has an ArrayList of UberStatements.
 
 It overrides the createStatement() method to give one of these UberStatements out, each which
 has it's own "taken" boolean. If it finds no statements out, it creates one and adds it.
 If it finds that more than 20% of the statements are not taken at the moment, it cuts half
 of those 20% out by closing them.
 
 The UberStatement class has a boolean called taken, and an overridden close method that basically
 turns taken to false, but does not close the method. Instead, a destroy method allows for that to
 happen. When the connection is created, it starts with the minimum Iterator number of UberStatements.
 
 
 So the price problem:
 
 Resource rates go too fast, at 2.7 - exponentially. They should probably
 grow like x^2 to match the unit prices - because units do grow like n^2 and I like
 that idea. If the prices do not grow exponentially...then, unit prices do grow
 the same way that rates do. What has to be changed?
 
 1. Building caps
 2. Bomber numbers
 3. CSL amounts
 
 As for build times...they need to drop like the same way that unit numbers rise.
 You could always just make the unit build times follow a production curve
 according to the CSL which is a measure of growth. But clearly the CSL only really
 represents like uh...well it's like one building, for each unit, times sqrt(2),
 so it's really not that representative, as people differ their military amount.
 
 Well I think we needed to mult it by the city number anyway, because people tend to
 group their numbers in the cities.
 
 So things to do:
 1. Find the old build cap article, rewrite and apply it - and do it with three hours, not one hour!---CHECK---
 2. Change the building prices and caps!---CHECK---
 3. Change the bombing eqns.---CHECK---
 4. Change the CSL both in the Controller code, in the getCSL, and probably in combat somewheres.---CHECK---
 5. Change the building times...units no longer grow exponentially...they grow like (lvl+1)^2.---CHECK---
 6. Change the building times for buildings.---CHECK---
 7. Change civvy build times.---CHECK---
 8. Change research building times.---CHECK---
 9. Change scouting.---CHECK---
 
 Building time change:
 Well generally we want to be able to make them to the point where roughly n=4*sqrt(6)*(lvl+1)*
 then basically I mean unit numbers rise like mine numbers do... so generally we just
 want the rebuild times to change significantly...so uh...let's say we want to get you to the point
 where your price level is like say 3 hours of production in 24 hours. So then how do we do that?
 In each town, we measure the average mine level and then uh... we... then figure out how many
 troops one can buy with the resources from a three hour time period and then say it'll
 take four days to make those so figure the build times by dividing four days by the number.
 Then you can bring in engineers and have the caps from a building of identical level to average
 mine level knock down the price by 1/e.
 
 So we want the building time to be proportional to the global average level of your buildings.
 We take this to determine how many soldiers is the point where time should reach a certain extent
 for the next soldier. Each soldier needs to take more and more time...
 
So it should take four days for you to reach your maximum for a unit type. Do we go by
unit types or by all units? We should go by all units. So we know that the true n we're looking for
is the average CSL of all of your towns. So the formula for unit build times has got to be gradually extending...

How the fuck do we do this? We want the time to start small and work up to a limit. Basically
we have a graph of t v size, and as size increases, t does as well. We want the area under
the line to be equal to 4 days. The line can really be anything - or can it - it's constrained
by the size and the time required. So we solve for it.

Lets say then that TimeForTroop(x) = ax where x is the troop number, then we integrate that
from 0 to CSL, and that should be days. Since we're integrating what is essentially time,
then we set it to days.

So then Integrate[ax,{x,0,CSL}] = Days. Then aCSL^2=Days, and a = Days/CSL^2.

So then t = (4 days)*number/(CSL^2) s = 345600*number/(CSL^2)

Then we want engineers to be able to get it down to like a minimum of 1 day rebuild. We
want this to be the number of engineers you have in one building of the level dictated by that CSL.
But then new cities simply can't compete - well, not yet. But that's okay...or should it go by town, so all can
contribute equally across them? No...generally if you have enough towns that it's an issue for a new one, it should
not take long to grow it using your other resources. If we multiply it by

Exp(1-townEngineers/capForLevelAtCsl)/E(1) Which leads to a 36% decrease when you've got one
CY filled with engineers at that level. Works for me.

Final time fix then:

t = Sigma(Expmod,345600*(number)*Exp(1-townEngineers/capForLevelAtCSL)/(Exp(1)*CSL^2))

This is for soldiers. For each unit type, gotta sort of cycle through how many soldiers would build in that period.

Alright now for the civvy units. I guess we can use the same formula except do we really use CSL?
No, no need really...it's a bit different. Use the building's cap. 

t = 345600*(number)*Exp(1-townEngineers/capForLevelAtBuildingLevel)/(BuildingCap^2)

Building time fix:

Just use the Exp(1-townEngineers/capForLevelAtCSL) thing.

Knowledge fix:

Just use the same Exp thing above, but use average building level cap. I mean this basically means
research scales with your growth - you can be any size nation and still reach where you need to go.
How do reward larger nations? Well, we could make so you always need two levels above your average level
to get it down to 33% take off. So it gets harder and harder to keep up, the larger you get. Which I guess is kind of cool.
So let's just go off of their average level.

 Tanks v Juggers v Soldiers, what do they need to have to fix the imbalance?
 
 Currently DR is right, one Jugger getting 4x less cover is fucking ridiculous. It needs
 to change, perhaps being removed entirely. In the tests that we've found, where
 1 tank = 10 soldiers, does not include the fact that each weapon class is stronger.
 
 So a tank holding two tier 2 weapons is on average gonna be 10% stronger than soldiers
 holding two tier 1 weapons - though soldiers can hold tier 2 weapons. If the soldiers
 did wield a tier 2 weapon, then the tank is even with the soldier, but the soldier gives
 up it's diversity in exchange for this power up, so that cancels. The tank does not have to.
 
 So the tank can be, at max, 10% more powerful than 10 soldiers. It's actually worth 11. And
 it's 2x as fast. The formula for the next weapon is 2(old)+.1*old, so 100+10 = 110.
 
 So for Juggers, we get 2(old)+.1*old = 2(2(soldier)+.1(soldier))+.1(2(soldier) + .1(soldier))
 
 = 4s+.2s + .2s + .01s = 4.41s, when equipped with two tier 3 weapons, as opposed to like
 eight tier 1 weapons or four tier 2 weapons. So they actually are let's see... .41/4, which is
 about 10-11% stronger than 40 soldiers. So in both cases we have two units that are 10% stronger than
 their equivalent in soldiers.
 
 But the Jugger is 4x faster, and the tank 2x faster. Well, if they are 10% stronger, why not
 make them each only get a 10% detriment in defense? Then tanks count as 11, and Juggers as like 44.
 So they hit harder but take more damage. This doesn't account for the speed - though if we delete
 the speed, and we do this, then the balance does not give way to diversity but to sameness.
 
 You NEED soldiers to scout. You NEED bombers to bomb. What do you need tanks and Juggers for?
 Well, we can give the Juggers the speed bonus - them getting such a high speed rating is awesome.
 Tanks are kind of halfway there, 2x the speed, so they need something else. 
 
 If you made all the cover sizes the same as the actual sizes, what you could do, is allow for
 tanks to be worth less in cover. They could only be worth 90% of the CSL. 
 
 That just seems kinda one sided. Clearly, you need to think of something...
 
 1. Soldiers = Scouts
 2. Tanks = CSL Reduction?
 3. Juggers = Moar cargo?
 
 
 
 
 
 Iterators 2.0:
 
 Iterators do not load players, the search for any sql entries with
 timers and decrement them, moving across the playerbase. When a timer hits zero,
 the player is loaded if it is not already, as well as any other players if they are not already,
and a flag goes off to let everybody know in all possible tomcats that this player cannot be accessed.
Then the data is calculated and rewritten..

The only players which would necessarily be retained in memory would be the ones with programs
activated...but even they would no longer be necessary when you separate the programs onto
separate servers!

To do this:
1. Change everythign form players.size to like getPlayers().size and these players will only
be loaded when they are needed, and taken from memory if they are already in it.
2. Switch the iterators over to timer decrementation.

 Separate servers of 25 players each with a battlehardcall thing in BattlehardFunctions
 that just makes server calls and parses. Have an is=alive on each gigabyte server, and it loads
 and run player threads and isalive returns nothing then restart thes erver, separate the players up
 and run gigabyte tests on them. Spin up a new gigabyte every time you need one or one dies.
 
 Dad's evolution:
 
 Okay so on the UI for HQ, under the Cover meter there will be a slider for 
 quality, and on it will be a notch from 0-200%. This notch represents the average quality of your
  troops relative to their standard blueprint level. When you send an attack you 
  move another slider along there to choose the quality of troops you want to send into combat.
   If send really high quality ones and you lose them all, then the average quality 
   level goes down. Vice versa happens when you send crappy ones. So your population of troopers
    evolves over time based on the quality of the men that are dying, like natural
     selection except governed by you. I know how to do it. I just need your thoughts
      on it and some other people's. Is it needed, would it make the game better?
 
 
 
 
 
 Capital Cities:
 
 How do we implement them?
 
 Well, the easiest way would to just have a town ID associated with each player
 that is their capital city. If it's negative 1, they have not set it yet, or have
 lost the town(you must set this up.) 
 
 If it is negative one, they can do makeCapitalCity(tid) on some place. Then,
 if the town called for building, leveling, etc, well, really just building buildings,
 is using lotNums beyond it's means, it's a-okay.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Rewiring the Alamo Effect:
 
 Some goals of this discussion:
 
 1. Max limit on the Alamo effect needs to be a % based on your stealth tech and theirs.
 2. The new Alamo calculation needs to allow for a normal sized army to defend a normal sized town,
 and it needs to be proportional to the building levels in the town. Stealth and concealment
 cannot come into the calculation - concealment is what's altered, and stealth must determine the
 limit at which concealment cannot be altered further, but someone MUST be able to easily
 see what size army they can send.
 
 Okay so question: How large should an army be based on building size? Should it even be based on buildings
 or just on mines? Mines are what determine the army. But really we should just go based on aggregate weighted
 level. 
 
 Just make the town one giant building with the cap on it - it already works for troops as they price like civvies.
 Then multiply it by au slot size  because six different unit types means generally they will afford
 6x as many units as if they had one unit type, and they'll easily over extend. So it'll scale with them!
   
   From this we determine the bottom of the exponential and the top we get just by calculating the normal stuff.
   
   Now, the limit on this exponential should be based on your stealth tech and theirs. How do we compute that?
   
   Your max decrease in attributes
   is 1-.035*stealthTech. So it's good to have a high stealth. This means a farmer can fight Alamo, but not permanently.
   The best they can hope for is 70% limit. At the default 3, they'd get a little over 10% protection from Alamo.
 
 	And then finally one derives concealment from this. Or maybe, we could derive all things?
 	Hell just reduce fucking everything. As long as tanks and juggers contribute 2x and 4x as much to being hard to hide,
 	then the 2x and 4x relation for speed works out.
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 	
 Rewiring Exp Adv in combat:
 
 So generally, we want the expmods to be based on hwo much
 each unit is worth. This is still fair as they all do proportionate
 damage. But what we want is for a 5:1 in a town of x pop, where the
 5 gets less concealment, to be the point at which the exp adv
 they gain from having those numbers outdoes that loss.
 
 So, generally, speaking, the defensive side does 5x more damage/person
 in concealment than the offensive side due to their concealment lack,
 actually 10x if they are attacking.
 
 But the 5 side is doing in general 1x damage/person but there are 5x as many,
 so actually the thing is quite even unless they are attacking. In this simple
 system we are just assuming that the...let's just get the eqns.
 
 			double expTerm1 = Math.exp(-(currentExpAdvSizeOffWithDivMods+1)/((sigmaTerm+1)*holdAttack.town1.getStealth()*(holdAttack.town2.getPop()+1)/2));

		okay so assuming everything is the same, we look at Exp(-5/x)/Exp(-1/x) = .Epx(-5/x+1/x)=Exp(-4/x).
	
 Okay so then we can say that is the ratio of C_5/C_1. This is directly
proportional to the ratio of damage they do per soldier to one another, assuming
that they both gun for concealment(even if they don't, when x is a certain number,
it naturally comes out to choose that frac, and this is the situation we're looking for-
not a small army in a big town defending from a big army but small army-small town, big town.

	 But generally...exp advantage is applied whether or not you hit a small town...that's
	 what we want to stop - smaller armies getting creamed to shit. The alamo effect
	 simply does not apply in large towns with small armies that are being rebuilt.
	 How do we protect them?
	 
	 Hrm. Well, if we set the limit for C_5/C_1, we generally want that exp advantage
	 should be equal given same x's. But we can't, there is a second variable, x,
	 that prevents us from isolating when it is.
	 
	The answer is, we need to ask, independent of concealment, how curved do we want
	that advantage line to be? At 5:1 the 5 gets only 30% of damage done to it
	and 1 gets 27% more damage done to it. We already knew 1 was screwed, but should
	the 30% be there? I mean shit, that's like next to nothing on the 5 army died.
	
	At .15 for a constant, we get that the 5 guys take 54% damage, and the defenders
	take 112% damage. Now if they were fighting in a small town where the 5's concealment
	was degraded to like Exp(-5/1)/Exp(-1/1) and you get .018, then they are taking about 50x more
	damage due to concealment. So the 1 generally does .6 soldiers worth *50 of damage on the 5, downgraded
	to .3*50 = 15x by this new formula, and 9x by the old. So they actually do take out
	more soldiers per capita.
	
	I think we need to degrade to .1, not .3.. That means at 2:1
	you experience 90% damage on 2 and 105.1% damage on 1. Not bad, it's a nice little
	reward for outnumbering, but not too large. And at Exp(-2/1)/Exp(-1/1)  you get
	.36, which means the 1 does 3x as much damage roughly as the 2, and the 2 does
	2x as much damage as the 1 would normally do without the conc advantage
	because of having twice the numbers, and after exp adv, the 1 does
	3x*.9 = 2.7x, and the 2 does 2x*1.05=2.1. So in the 2:1 situation, the 1 guys
	actually hit a little harder, and probably keep doing so for some time. When do they not?
	
	At 4:1, it's 74% and 107%, respectively. This is a nice number because the damage
	gained by the defense grows slowly with size, since they're being pummeled anyway,
	while the real reward for the offensive is losing a hell of a lot less.
	
	It's gonna need to stay this way if we're going to make it hard to kill small armies
	in small villages, because this can't have an effect until large size.
		
	Now how do we reduce it further using armor? We want to make having higher armor
	an absolute reduction of the exp-adv - a way to form it off. So it's got
	to be that armor somehow reduces the damage taken
	
 	Well we could use the fraction of armors on the exp...so if you had half the armor
 	and you were attacking, then they'd do 2x more damage on you than normally,
 	
 	So it'd calculate the damage dealt, and  then it'd multiply that by uh...
 	well the difference in average armor could be huge...you'd have to calculate
 	it and it could make a guy who was only receiving 86% due to numbers get a 1.5
 	and get hit even harder...and then when somebody is getting pummeled they'd switch
 	to high armor units that hit concealment and they'd get like 50x damage from concealment
 	and then get a 1.5-2 modifier on the exp adv and just destroy incoming armies.
 	Not sure how fair that'd be. Hell, it'd be kinda cool, because those defending units
 	would be like unable to go anywhere quickly - highly armored behemoths with sniper rifles...
 	
 	So what we want to do is not increase the damage done by the unit but reduce the damage
 	taken. So a max would be you take 0% damage due to armor, and that'd mean if you
 	hit somebody hard in concealment due to low conc-high armor, the high armor could
 	actually offset that loss. That cannot happen, I will not do it.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Quest System:
 
 How should the quest system work? Well, I want people to be capable of being
 on multiple quests, and I want quests to have a quest line. I want the quests
 to be listener programs that get "iterated" every time the player does to check
 for things. 
 
 So do we want a quest database, and all the quests are loaded in server start up?
 That'd certainly be the easiest way to do it, and then there could be an array
 of Quest objects that are loaded classes with names, and when people choose
 a quest one is instantiated and tacked onto their player. There'd be a second
 table that links players to quest ids. We'll make quests a separate db.
 
 So the quest-player table will be pid,qid,completed, and if completed is -1,
 it hasn't been loaded, if it's 0, it has been loaded but not completed, and if 1,
 has been completed. So we'll have a Quest object that every Quest must implement,
 and there will be certain methods they must have:
 
 1. iterate() method - this method is called every time a player iterates.
 2. Add Player method - if a quest is going to contain multiple players, it needs
 to keep an array list of them, and they need to know of it by having it
 in their array list. This is where you can check whether or not to reject players.
 3. rewardAndDestroy() method - what happens if the iterate finds that the quest is complete
 and it should kill itself by doing the rewardAndDestroy method where it wraps
 everything up, and then does the markDone method.
 4. complete() method - already set up as part of the interface.
 
 Then the player just iterates all their quest listeners every 10s.
 
 Things to do:
 
 1. Create the QuestListener interface. ---CHECK----
 2. Make it so God loads them on startup, and the programs
 are each attached to the players, and that they iterate.---CHECK---
 3. Make a getQuestCompleted(qid) function to player.---CHECK---
 4. Make it so player reload rethinks quests. ---CANT, MANY-TO-MANY, MAY BE VARIABLES
 THAT THE QUEST HOLDS ON TO!---
 
 Tests to do:
 
 1. Write a quest that just tests to see when you get a certain res hit. Have it reward and
 then destroy your player off it.---CHECK---
 2. Write a quest that won't let you join unless your player has a certain quest completed.(Last)---CHECK---
 3. Test out the addTown and killTown methods.---CHECK---
 4. Test out the storage and questlog stuff.---CHECK---
 5. Print out the players and make sure quests only get repped once.---CHECK---
 6. Test that support allows you to remove/add players to quests.---IMPOSSIBLE.---
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Resource advantages in certain towns:

Install resAdvantages that are stored in towns in the inc sections as percentage points.
Now we have a new use for them. Each town starts with a default of zero but when you
do the Id repop it can create some that have different things.
1. Create the array---CHECK---
2. Create readinwriteoutsynchronize procedures---CHECK---
3. Modify the League suck up equations iterate and your iterate---CHECK---
4. Modify the variables in the tres databasaes to be doubles.---CHECK---
5. Include resAdvantage or whatever in this fucking town of yours. JSON style.---CHECK---
6. Modify placement code to autochoose place of 0000 for beginner player.---CHECK---
7. Modify growId to make every fourth town a normal one. Then the placement will
auto work with the new system.---CHECK---







 Memory Cycle:
 
Could turn God's getPlayers() array into an array of like player-object like strings
that have a get method that return a player if there is one so getPlayers().get(i)
returns first an object like PlayerList, and then PlayerList has a get(i) function,
and if the get is called, then a Player object is loaded up and returned. A separate
AI will load and iterate the players. As the players need other ones, those players are loaded
up in a very clever way. Then they can still do the work, without the problems.

See, lets say player x needs player y and player y has support units from z. Then
x calls y who gets loaded up and in turn calls z who gets loaded up. X then does its stuff
and all the players are dumped. Then y gets called up and loads up z, and so on.
The separate AI doing the iterating would be like an iterator, there'd be like 100
of these threads sucking up players and iterating them. They'd of course check current memory -
if the player was loaded for another, and hasn't been dumped yet, it'll on synchronize,
just iterate that one.

Of course, if a player has "canJava" on, then it takes up a slot permanently, if it's program
is currently running. If not, it slips back into the fold.

To do:
1. Make a PlayerList object that holds names of players, and has a get function
that loads up ones that are not currently in memory. You'll need to redo
the way God loads up - it simply doesn't need to anymore, no more threading for God.
2. Create the iterators, which call get periodically on players who's current
tick rating hasn't been updated yet(keep this all in memory in the playerlist) 
and run them(so they'll naturally call ones already loaded or load them if need be).
3. Make it so the iterators do not unload a player once it's been iterated if it's
running a java program.
4. Make God just do a counter iteration, for the GodCounter.
5. MAKE EVERYTHING SYNCHRONIZED TO AN EXTREME DEGREE!
6. Make the iterators always seek the lowest tick and grab it if they can(synchronized).
7. Make the Watcher AI, which watches Iterators and sees if the number of players
unprocessed goes to zero before the game clock factor goes past, and if it doesn't,
then increase the number of iterators.

To just make a thread pool:
1. Create a GameClock that God increments and each player has one
2. Iterators search players that do not match current game clock. Once
they detect no players have a lack of this game clock, they then go and request
a new gameclock from the server.

Valid quasithoughts: You obviously have to choose one player, and then
once it's loaded, try to load it's raidsntrades, and then those'll load
the other ones as required. So then it'd all work. So now, it'll do like synchronize,
it'll load just ONE player, and then ask for that ONE player's raidsntrades,
and each get will be like a little spark calling another player. I mean,
that's how we find these players, right? By loading them up! Now, if a player
is loaded up, it's only gonna remain in memory for as long as it takes the iterator
to find it needs an update, update it, and trash it. So if you've got 100 iterators
and some 10,000 players, chances are you're going to have a few thousand loaded
and the iterators will be dropping them out as fast as they can but more likely than
not, you'll have 9900 loaded and 100 being loaded again. But that would only happen
if the time it takes to iterate all the players through and dump them is greater
than the gameClockFactor - then clearly then the iterators are overloaded, 
and so the players in memory will get dumped only to get lifted again, and dumped,
and so on, because they'll all be lagging behind. Eventually you'd get somet hat
are five ticks behind, and you'll need to go to the lowest tick first, but if you can't
keep up with the counter, you're screwed. You'll need to make a protection for that.

 
 
 JPI Security AI:
 
 Okay so what we need to first cut out any trailing white space between
 periods, and then do a basic contains test that tests for a battery
 of different statements and/or keywords that we can store in a DB.
 Then if we make any hits we test to see if it's in quotations.
 If it fails we send it back. 
 
 
 Okay use the link and code to have a single AI that takes in and measures
 program usage. This AI will exist as a separate program on a separate
 server. It's job will be to create mini-programs that do memory tests.
 So what users will do is when they compile, the program
 first goes through above and is checked, and if it passes that stage,
 it is passed to this AI(by setting a flag) that puts it on a queue to be measured.
 Then once it's been measured and passed, it gets checked off as approved
 and then the program can be loaded by the user.
 
 The AI will have to load player copies(all the way down to other players?) and use those in the class and let
 it get initial memory, and if it's above .025MB, kill it off. Then,
 do a join() and wait for it to finish - start a separate timer thread
with a random number of ticks and then store the reference to that thread.
Come back and check it later and see memory usage then. If the program
isn't dead yet and memory is growing,
you can say there is a memory leak. If it has any memory remains
below the limit, then it's okay. Then the program shuts itself down and updates the database.

Also have a second thread that checks the AI and if it's own memory grows beyond say 10Mb then
kill it off to save the server.

So the different states are:
-1. Latest compile failed.
0. Ready to Submit Compile/Latest Compile Successful
1. Compiling
2. In Gigabyte processing

So at any time they can hit run and if their class file exists, it'll run it,
but if they want to submit a new one they need to go through the process.

The second they hit compile, then it goes to 1. Remember
that the class loaded should not be loaded into here, only made into a class,
to test if it compiles. This should be done on Gigabyte and sent back
as if it did or did not compile. This way, the old class file remains intact!

 Theory of different tick lengths:
 
 If the tick lengths were set at once every 10 seconds,
 and all the wait times were multiplied proportionately, then
 you'd have longer processing times with the allowed same effects - but you'd have
 to make it so that no event could happen in between those 10 seconds. So raids
 would always have to have integral multiples of 10, things like that. Resource
 increases would be every ten seconds, and basically raids/trades/tradeschedules/buildings/queues/
 anything with a timer must be modded to ten seconds.
 
 I mean really if you made all the "wait time" changes by ten it'd work as a game
 but then the game would be ten times slower - so you'd probably want to divide
 all the times by ten and multiply all the incs by ten. You could actually set this
 up as a "game clock." You'd divide intervaltime by ten for tradeschedules because people will
 input that in seconds, undoubtedly.

 Theory of Asynchronous Operation:
 
 The basic idea is there is a timer and we use that timer to make the player do everything
 it would have in that time period. So whenever the user uses BHFunctions, whenever he
 hits any command, then synchronization happens first. Now players are not lone objects.
 When a player loads a world map then all players inside need to synchronize. Whenever one player
 has a raid or a trade transferring to another player, that player needs to be synchronized first, too.
 Basically in this way an expanding web of synchronization happens in webs across the game as
 people play it, as opposed to it all happening at once at a steady cadence. 
 
 So the protocols:
 
 1. Whenever a BF call is made, synchronize.
 2. Whenever a controller call is made, synchronize.
 3. When worldMap is called, sync everybody in that area.
 4. When a Raid reaches it's end, synchronize both parties involved.
 5. When a Trade reaches it's end, synchronize both parties involved.
 6. Add a sync timer so that as you add over cities, if it takes time, then
 the resTimer will have it account for it in the additions as it's adding instead
 of going through everything again, so that if it takes like 15s for Id to do one iteration,
 then it will ad 4 s, then 5s, then 6s, to each resource as it goes through towns,
 and have it cycle through each building, trade, and raid accordingly. May
 have to rewire building server a bit.
 
 
Support System:

Chg = 0 is normal, chg =1 on player means pause,
chg = 2 means take it all in again.

CHECK FOR INCOMING RAIDS BEFORE YOU DO THIS - IF YOU DO DURING A RAID, THE OTHER
GUY WILL LOSE HIS MEN BUT THIS GUY WILL NOT!

DO NOT DELETE BUILDINGS. DO NOT CHANGE THEIR TYPES.
If you have to, make sure there are no outgoing genocides/glassings and
that all queues in that building are deleted as well.

The Weather System:

Let's think. How do want this to work. Generally we know we want
each "unit" of weather to take from one attribute and add to another.
There are, of course, seven attributes to take from, leading to 7*6
= 42 different weather combos.

We want a random walk quality to this system - we want individual units
to have a randomly generated speed(weighted, of course) and we want
them to combine with other units when they hit each other. When they strike each
other, their new velocities need to be computed as well as their new momentums.
I'd like the new combos to slow down also, and be harder to change direction.
They will of course combine effects.

Every unit will have an average depletion time before it dissipates and combos
will be the weighted average of their times, so that big ones can't gain
too much traction. There needs to be a conservation thing so whenever
one dies, another is created. The number needs to be proportional
the size of the server and entry points need to be random.

Okay so we need to set up some...plans.

1. Create the weather AI.---CHECK---
2. Create the weather unit, which keeps track of combos.---CHECK---
3. Persistence---CHECK---
4. Make the weather AI drift the weather units---CHECK---
5. Allow weather units to combine, make them slower and combination of speeds---CHECK---

they deplete.---CHECK---

The League System:

So, the league system. What are some attributes that I want?
-I want a taxing system
-I want a league bank
-I want the league bank to have traders
-I want the league to be able to assign ranks
-I want the league to be able to have a description page and website link.
-I want the league to be able to have different permission sets.
-I want those with permission to be able to download a grid of their users as a Jason
array and a grid of all enemies they have attacked or have been attacked by in the last ten days. They
can limit by league if they wish.

Alright so let's think of implementation.

So we need to rethink this shit: Okay so I want to work within our system.
I want there to be "league-owned" towns and a league player. The first question is:
Given a league town, if you have a lot of members, your league town will not
exactly have the caps to make having warehouses useful. So you're going
to need a special kind of player, called League. Leagues will have towns, certainly,
and they will have extra permissions too. So leagues will have extra entries with
descriptions, and a table of tprs. The thing is the towns they have will have overloaded
building add methods that do not allow additions of warehouses. The towns will
be able to build traders, men, have units, etc., and will have places on the map.
You'll have to log in through your communications center - the initial player will
have the so called "Master Pass," but others'll have to go through the communications center
login to log in and it'll check TPRs. 

So then what does the communications center do for you? Well, instead of gathering
average trade tech or anything like that from players, we set the resCaps of every town
the league player gets by using the weighted average cap of communications centers.

Also, league players are not allowed to invade. They can only be given towns. So
league towns will often be in areas near other players.

Okay so list of things to do:
1. Create the League that extends player, with all the tprs and everything
you need for data creation, and persistence. You will have to initialize it
like a player, use that constructor(easily done) and then if it has
league affiliation, enact the league constructors. However, I do not think it will
need a league constructor if you do it correctly. Let it do everything a player
does already, just override methods that allow for certain buildings.---CHECK---

2. Expand tprs to include tids (if they are moderators.) Then these moderators can
only have access to so many towns. Admins have access to everything.---CHECK---

3. Utilize the createPlayer through battlehard functions to create leagues off
of player-given towns. Control functionality to remove privileges, add them, etc.---CHECK---

4. Think of a way to easily implement league control functionality into bhf
by moderators/admins without logging in - do they get the league player reference
in their player to access? What? Probably the easiest way is if they
control those towns, to just put references in their towns array. But then they'll
be doing cycle-throughs, so put it in and if it's a league town, don't do anything to it
- it just allows those players to access and modify those towns.---CHECK---

5. Implement tax rates.---CHECK---

6. Implement persistence---CHECK---

 Mines and Warehouses:

 Well, clearly warehouse storage amounts have to grow exponentially. The
 amount they grow should be the sum of their cost (we use this instead
 of a straight number so we have the flexibility to change it). To make
 the resource cap work, we first need to figure out resources.
 
 Okay so all of the mines combine together to contribute to an easily
 referencable inc variable. So we create the mine buildings and
 you need to modify create player to "add" these buildings
 and lotTech to be stored correctly. The mine buildings each
 contribute to the increase rate, so whenever one is increased in level,
 we re-adjust the resource increase rate for that town. Now, these
 rates are per second. Unfortunately, this means they can't be less than one.
 We need to modify the database to except doubles for this job, and
 then create a holder "double" for each resource that isn't recorded,
 and every second, these doubles are added to. When the double >= 1, 
 then that double is emptied till it gets to <1 again.(Because at one point
 they may make more than 1/sec.)
 
 Every turn if the resource to be added is greater than the total warehouse
 amount(easily calculable and kept till a warehouse levels) then we do not keep
 the resource.
 
 To do:
 1. Implement mine buildings.---CHECK---
 2. Store new ones in the db for each and every town with a quick textdemo type program.---CHECK---
 3. Alter create player to have these buildings.---CHECK - ID ALREADY HAS BUILDINGS ON CREATION!---
 4. Create the non-stored double holder variable array and delete the db incs,
 calculate inc on level up of building or server start.---CHECK---
 5. Create the non-stored caps for each building at load up and adjust only when
 one levels up, or on server start.---CHECK---
 6. Create the protocols in player to increment the holders with the incs and to suck out
 all whole numbers whenever >1 to be added to the real resources, and to not add more
 than the caps.---CHECK---
 7. Make mailing system more manageable by allowing hashes of user groups and users
 to be sent in, created, and destroyed. Do this by creating a user group
 table that points to the player, and there is a user table that has entries
 of player names and user groups, so that each entry points to a group. Create
 the commands for battlehardfunctions to get and receive these. Do not have to change
 the message table structure though, just create multiples. Can just add a "subject id"
 so all have that same unique identifier for combinations! Then you can do google like
 email. Also add creation time.---CHECK---

 
 Tests:
 Mines:
 1. Test resource rate gens by printing out small increments over time and setting it low.---CHECK---
 2. Do it again but make sure whole numbers add.---CHECK---
 3. Hit a cap.---CHECK---
 
 Mail:
 4. Send a few single messages, see if number of packs increases correctly.---CHECK---
 5. Send a few more messages, tagged to each other for each one and see if they group correctly.---CHECK--
 6. Delete the first, middle, and last messages, respectively from the pack, see how it works out.---CHECK---
 7. Test that referring to later messages in a tree works (for original_message_id.) ---CHECK---

 Research System:
 
 You need to implement missing techs - like Bomber and Bomber resistance Tech.
 Have you make "discoveries" to research or choose among a pool based on your experiences.
 So if you fight a lot, combat researches come up more often in your discoveries.
 
 	RESEARCHES:
	LotTech, StealthTech(maxed at 20, see scouting block), Unit Techs, Weapon Techs,  HP Increase Tech, Support and Attack conglomeration techs, Next Town tech,
	Each of the civilians can have it's efficiency upgraded, building slot tech, building stability tech, bunker tech
	Engineer, Trader, Scholar Tech, add 10% efficiency to time decrease, carry alotments, everything, for each and every one!
	
	MAKE SURE TECHS ARE COUPLED LIKE BUNKER TECH WITH SOMETHING ELSE COMBATIVE(weapons?).
	
	Stealth is more important for offensive, couple with Bunker Tech, a defensive trait.
	(Approximately twice as useful for offensive as defensive, if you check. This is how
	it's paid for.)
	
	Trade Tech has a max of 10.
	
	You need to edit Maelstrom to include the Research System.
	
	Techs:
	Lot Tech
	Stealth
	attack lot tech
	4 unit techs
	IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED
	Troop push
	Bunker level up
	IMPLEMENTATION END
	21 weapon techs
	Support tech
	Town tech
	3 Civilian Efficiencies
	Building Slot Tech
	Building Stability Tech(not implemented, I don't think)
	bunker tech
	Bomber Tech
	Trade Tech
	Pic techs[35]
	Assume each has a max of 10 except stealth tech.
	Total: 
	10*(9) + 20 + 21 + unlimited town techs + 20 stealth + 35 = approximately 200 tech upgrades. <--- NEED TO REWIRE THIS FORMULA
	AFTER ADDITIONS
	
	LotTech is for building slots, buildingSlotTech is for how many can be building
	at a time! lotTech needs implementing.
	
	God damnit we need a better system. We clearly cannot use knowledge as a "resource."
	We need to use the people directly. Have an AI That works a little harder
	and a little faster as your numbers increase. So if we have each breakthrough
	becoming "available" at longer and longer time intervals...say we have it grow not
	exponentially but like x^2.5 where x is breakthrough number. We have 200 technology
	upgrades to worry about and we want them to only successfully be able to get 25%
	of them by the end of 12 months with no scholars. We want 4 techs chosen ON AVERAGE
	per breakthrough, which means 4 techs a break through means 200/4 = 50 something
	breakthroughs for everything. We want 15 in 12 months. So what y,
	x^y s (where x is breakthrough) when x is integrated from 0 to 15, gives 12 months?
	
	Let's use mathematica. Using y = 6.099 gets us about a year.
	
	Now we can lower breakthrough times by doing something like
	
	x^y -> divide into two parts  1/5th + (5/6ths+.5(5/6)*towns.size)* Math.exp(-Math.log((totalScholars*(1+t.player.God.Maelstrom.getResearchEffect(t.x,t.y))+1))/(10))
	 
	 
	(just use the building level up code for this)
	
	on average you get 4 PER UPGRADE but don't really get 4 per research - you get 2 for the first ten,
	then 3 the second, then 4 the third, then 5 the fourth, and 6 the fifth - this adds to
	2+3+4+5+6 = 20 * 10 = 200 researches
	
	So there is that base time protection, and every time you add a town, you get 
	an extra fifty percent of the deductible added on, but once you get that town
	up to full status, you get an effective exponential factor decrease that makes it better.
	
	
	Now to group technologies. You get 10 available techs, can only choose 4.
	

	Defensive Tech 
	Stealth - Every round
	Bunker tech - Every round
	Building Stability Tech - Every round
	Defensive Might - If you're winning defensive battles(ie taking out a certain portion more)
	Bunker level up - if you get like 3 defensive techs in a row, you are presented with this option.
	
	Offensive Tech
	Stealth(20) - Same as above
	Bomber Tech - Doing a lot of bombing relative to toher runs.
	Troop Push - If you do three offensive techs in a row.
	
	Military Output Tech
	Support tech - If you support or are supported often.
	Unit techs(4) - Every third breakthrough
	Weapon techs(21) - Randomly thrown in - but only if you have a unit that can
	equip them, or a unit tech is available to research that can!
	Lot Tech - If you max out like 90% of your lots.
	Attack Lot Tech - If you max out your attack unit slots, increase probability.
	
	Economic Output Tech
	Trade Tech - If you uh make a lot of trade schedules, have a high leveled trade center, lots of traders.
	Engineering Tech - If you have high CYs or a lot of Engineers
	Scholar Tech - If you have a higher number of scholars.
	Building Slot Tech - If you level up often
	Town Tech - Every second breakthrough or so. Given that there are a total of 12 in a year
	with no scholars, and maybe as much as 30 if there are, then 15 towns can be gotten.
	
	
	Probably best to do this one piece at a time and test it. How do you test it? Manufacture the situation
	in the db. This system may need user testing before it is fully viable.
	
	
	To do then:
	1. Create the framework and ticker. ---CHECK---
	2. Create the battlehard functions call. ---CHECK---
	3. Implement the new techs. ---CHECK---
	
	Tests to run:
	1. Test that breakthroughs happen on time and persistence.---CHECK---
	2. Test that you cannot grab unit techs or town techs or pic techs unless it's every 3, or whatever
	the rules are.---CHECK---
	3. Make sure breakthrough times are realistic(check each one for a bit.)---CHECK---
	4. Test out the new EngTech and ScholTech if you've got time.---NOPE.---

	
 
 For making new players, scripting:
 
 Need to create a new folder in userscriptsbin and src.
 
 
 
 Quest System Ideas:
 
 Like trade schedules if tid is -1, load the "quest town" for that player to attack.
 -2, load the other...and so on! Or keep them in global pointers, like questTown1. Or something.
 Or attach a copy of each quest town to a quest towns object in each Player to send to that's
 always some distance away from their main town! Cool, eh!?! Then when they send stuff, if
 you can't find it, it must be a QUEST TOWN. CHECK FOR IT! Or rather, have the front end
 allow them to "send" there via choice but then notify by calling an attack with a flag
 set to true telling you you've sent to a QUEST TOWN!
 v.09 list:
 To do for v.09!

Attack stuff:
1. Implement status reports to allow for easy viewing of attacks.---DONE---
1b. Allow for the ability to read in raids from God, no I don't care that they will be shifted around, it's necessary.---DONE---
1c. Allow read ins for the battlehardviewer, but no visual support yet...not necessary.---DONE--- (via statreports)
2. Fix basic attacking equations, with new HP stuff.---DONE---
		-Fix weapons values---DONE---
		-Fix equations---DONE---
3. Fix genocide by making sure civilians can be equipped with a weapon. ---DONE---
4. Create the glassing option, can be used with genocide or without, causes 25% decrease in collected resources, only with bombers.---DONE---
5. Implement veterancy.---DONE---
6. Implement supporting armies, and make sure they can attack if they are flagged to do so.(Also you must be able to support, not just receive.)---DONE---
7. Implement the scout function - can only be used with soldier units, and they must have a high concealment and be nearly unarmed to proceed.---DONE---
8. Implement invasion.(1.5wk)---DONE---
9. Implement any type of raid-recall(.5wk)---DONE---
11. Implement resupplying genocide and glassing runs(.75wk)---DONE---
12. Implement changing the bombing orders of glassing/genocide runs.(.25wk)---DONE---
13. Implement Bunker system. (2wk)---DONE---
14. Implement the pricing in returnPrice and the buildCombatUnit to include troops on raids and in foreign villages.(1day)---DONE---

15. Implement the HQ building, which controls raid slots. Supporting another player counts as a single raid slot. Will
need to rewire a lot of things to recognize this. Easy to find supports, just look for AUs attached to other cities
from your city, count the number of unique tids and there you have it! Can also derive the data this way.(.5wk) ---DONE---

16. Implement Queue system - this means that instead of keeping track of ppl left to build, there
is a separate queue table corresponding to queue objects stored in an arraylist on each building.
So for arms factories, a number is kept, and a slot focus, and so there doesn't need to 
be arrays anymore of numLeftToBuild or the columns in the SQL table, each query is dealt
with as it comes through the building server by decreasing ticks
and numbers left, until it's max units made are built and then the queue
is removed. This does not need to be done with people, you can just
have an x button there and ask for the amount or something.(1wk)---DONE---

Total:1.525 month remaining.

Do a round of Systems stuff here. Pick three major problems and solve them.
1. Memory leak in display software(1wk)---DONE---
2. Make God the primary reader/writer, have all players request updates through him or call his methods. Saves memory.(1wk)---DONE---
	-Can easily fix this by passing God's connection to the Players, this way they can keep using
	the same statement over and over again without a need ot recreate that statement every time
	the method is called. And if they lose the connection, they can call on God
	to re-establish it.
3. Fix the JPI to take multiple classes.(1wk)---DONE---
4. Fix PlayerScript to parse commands from display program.---DONE---


Menu stuff, after attack stuff:
1. Arms Factory unit build menu(1wk)---DONE---
2. Arms Factory unit creation menu(1wk)---DONE---
3. Bunker menu(1wk)---DONE---
4. HQ Menu(1wk)---DONE---
5. Combat simulator(1wk)---POSTPONED---
6. Implement concealment disguising raids from appearing, or that they even appear if one is coming to you.(.5wk)---DONE---


Total till next version: 3.5wk

 
 
 
 
Trading system:

Take into account that traders go up in price...may want to have them group
like soldiers.

Set up trading like raiding system.

1. Trade Routes:
	Alright, some options for trade routes:
	1. Two-Way or One-Way, Two-Way requires a message to be sent.
	2. Has Interval in Days/Hours, number of times can be any number up to 50 or infinity.
	3. If a trade cannot be completed for whatever reason, it waits.

2. Stock Market
	So we need to somehow keep track of exchange rates. We can use the trade raid system
	thing but we have to somehow denote it's a stock market trade and just have it switch
	off resources. We need a separate thread called "Trader" that measures the ratios
	at an instant at decides the exchange rate. Now, if we go by the rate of trades
	happening in a certain instance, then anybody can upset the way of things
	by just having a lot of trades of 1 resource. If we go by volume, then the
	largest players have all the power over trades. But this is how it works in real life
	as well.
	
	The formula for the exchange rate is total_resource1/total_resource2.
	
	It defaults to 1 if there are 0 trades on either end and has a max trade
	ratio of 10:1 to protect from like 1000:1. Nobody'll make that trade
	and it will stay that way.
	
	Also, trader technology increases the time spent doing trades, and the amount
	of resources a trader can carry, by 10% * trade tech. Also, stock market prices
	can be augmented, so you can get a better rate by 10%*trade tech.
	
	How do players make new trade routes? By negotiating directly with nearby players,
	via messaging. Yes, you could offer a market place where players could shop for new
	routes and post them, but then where is the haggling? The communication?
	Talk to Markus more on this.
	
	Also by doing this, by making it non-visible, people can make money by passing
	along info about trade routes to other people, say if guy x knows guy y wants metal,
	and guy z has it, he can take a commission for setting up something. This is so
	much cooler.
	
	When you reach larger playerbase, you'll need to implement randomly choosing 1000 players.
	Or maybe even just 100. It looks like 2^63-100000*exp(30) yields a positive answer,
	so even with 100000 players at high levels, you're fine, and that's unlikely. So you
	CAN worry about this some other time!
	
	Good news is that stock market trades are pre-agreed two-ways so they count by
	Trader's count!
	
	To make a stock market trade, we set up a pre-agreed twoway trade with the tid2 = 
	-1, and so then if when we're reading in this data, we see -1, we just set town2 = null
	and set a stockMarketTrade on the TS object to let us know it's a stock marketer.
	
	Why do we keep agreed when we can just check for a mate? Because an unagreed two way
	just sits there, an agreed twoway that just lost it's mate due to a cancel on the other
	end is most certainly agreed but it doesn't know it has no mate until it checks. Basically,
	if it has no mate, we don't want it to delete itself before the other person can agree
	to the terms, because it has no mate during the time it's hanging in space and the other
	user is thinking about it!

	How much should a trader be able to carry as a base value and what is it's speed?
	
	300 carry and 100 speed, because it costs the same as a soldier and a soldier gets 400 points to spread
	amongst itself that it could put ALL in cargo. But why waste that kind of room when
	you can get as much out of a trader? We don't want players using soldiers for a kind
	of cargo, and we want a fair trade amongst units. If it's 300, then people will spend
	money on cargo whore units and raid instead of trading. Granted, raiding loses
	you more units, but they'll just leave themselves open or something. But then you
	gotta think...well that's  alot of fucking resources...if it were 80 resources each,
	then each trader would pay for itself by itself but you'll give it that factor
	extra of help...but shit, it's 400 resources because that's what a soldier could
	carry for the same price but away from a battlefield. I don't like it because
	I think it'll backfire a bit, but given that people'll grow, I think it'll
	be useful in the long run, to promote heavy free trade!
	
	How much will having TSes take slots, not trades, effect TSes themselves?
	
	Well then it becomes about bulk moving. A ts that does a 100 resource trade
	every ten days clearly is not worth as much as one that does a 1000 resource
	trade every hour. So what you'll see is people trading quickly and powerfully, moving
	as much as possible. Granted, they are limited by the number of traders they possess
	at any one time, as some may be out on another big trade, leaving a dearth, but
	that's alright. People will maximize it.
	
	Are trade records useful for data analysis?
	No, because while they track the amount of traders required, they have 0ed out
	resources at the end since resources can be exchanged at both ends and so we have
	to keep track of that in the db instead of a fixed variable. So what you should
	look at instead are trade schedules - all trades are derived from there and
	so you can use a smaller dataset to get even more data!

	On a stock market trade, town2 = town1. That's how we know it's a sm trade!
		    	
		   		/*
		 * The reason we only search out the mate once
		 * and never again if we have it is so we can save
		 * processing time. In certain instances when a schedule existed
		 * before a new server load, when it loads up it can't necessarily
		 * find it's mate even with it's id because that mate may not be laoded yet,
		 * so what happens is the first time it looks for it's mate(ie first getMate() call)
		 * it'll find it and save it. When a trade is set up within a same server session,
		 * the mate is found the second it's made! cool, eh?
		 * 
	Also look at getMate() for more information on threadSafety. This is how twoways
	keep from interacting and creating duplicates of one another.

 How do we make those little popup windows in bhviewer work?
 Well this is kind of complex. SO what we're going to do is we're going
 to only allow one pane to be added at a time, and we're going
 to just take a plain panel and put it in the layer above modal. Forgot
 what that is. Maybe the glass pane. Then we're going to equip it with
 a JTextField. 
 
 How does it activate? By not moving the mouse. If it reads your position as being
 over something, it'll set someHelpChosen=true and the message, and if a timer
 runs out it'll put that box above. When you move the mouse, the box is removed
 if it exists and the timer reset!
 
 
 
 
 
 Seeing attacks:
 This is definitely going to be a viewer phenomenon, though we could store it or something.
 Can't be coupled to Concealment as that's already way too valuable. Couple to
 stealth tech v bunker tech instead. Rename bunker tech "defensive tech."
 
 Formula would be like bunker/stealth. If bunker>stealth, then the attack
 shows up the second it's sent. If not, then it shows up when the time is
 equal to that fraction of the original time described by bunker/stealth.
 
 You're going to need to take into account the fact that Bunkers already
 present such a large advantage to players. Stealth does help determine
 concealment for both parties so stealth has defensive/offensive advantages,
 though it's twice as advantages to offensive players as defensive ones. Bunker
 has only defensive, so it's probably better to use it for seeing attacks.
 
 
 
 
 Finding Memory Leaks:
 What causes the largest leaks are background processes that run so periodically
 that no user could click a button fast enough to match their rate. User induced
 processes in the program do not contribute significantly to the memory leak. Therefore,
 leaving each menu or thing on in the display program is a good test to find leaks,
 because users clicking items will not contribute greatly to it over the common
 duration they run the program for!
 
 
 
 
 
 Stuff done for the Fighting System GUIs:
 
 To do: 
 1. Create the AUtemp table.---CHECK---
 2. Modify the attackunit table to include graphic.---CHECK---
 3. Modify the player table to have a boolean list of all the graphics that have been unlocked and AUTemplates pointer..---CHECK---
 4. Modify God to be able to read in such Data.---CHECK---
 5. Modify Player to be able to write out such Data.---CHECK---
 6. Modify the unit creation function to accept a code for which graphic we're talking about.---CHECK---
 7. Make a template unit creation function that doesn't put holds on the graphic number.---CHECK---
 8. Create the AU building table by having arms factory, then a list of attacked units
 that can be clicked. There should be a template list off to one side that will display
 your templates when one is selected, or an au when one is selected. When you select
 an empty slot you can replace with a template or replace one with no soldiers.
 The picture and textbox for building should be to the right, and there should be a build
 queue on the bottom.---CHECK---
 
 
 
 
 Rewiring the viewer:
 Here's how it's best to be: You basically changed your design around.
 Now, you're lower panel(mapPane) is the old battlehard viewer. When
 update is called on battlehardviewer, the paintComponent method is called on mapPane,
 which does everything, including loading players up and stuff. In a way
 this is just the same as the old AWT code, except now the pane
 does it. It also has a reference to the main layered pane it's a part of,
 so it should be capable of adding new objects to the layered pane on top
 or under it, allowing it to control the flow of execution without change.

Graphics Codes:

The way it works is the codes for each unit are read in like weapons
and stored in player-global boolean arrays for that index. Simple enough.
Each Attackunit is then loaded with it's proper graphic. The number of the graphic
corresponds to it's name - tank picture 1 is tank1.png.
 
 Why did you switch to string parsing for commands from the display viewer?
 Because it is less work for the processor than compiling a class every time
 and you can't import battlehard functions, which is useful.
 
 The defaults are the first 3 for all units except for bombers, which only gets the first 2.
 If you want to change this, change the new player code, not the db defaults, as the new player
 code instantly writes over that.
 
 
 
 How do you expand the JPI to multiple classes?
 
 By having userscripts under a separate user directory. Don't be a bitch.






 
 How did your memory problem work?
 
 When you do
 
 for(;;) {
 
 building b=new building(); }
 
 Each time it goes through, a new reference is created, and
 the variable that points to that reference is lost, but the reference
 is not collected by garbage collection even after
 you leave the scope. So you take building out
 and put it above the for. You did it for most everything
 but as the program gets used of course you missed stuff and memory
 will build up. You just have to restart every now and then
 and slowly find stuff.
 
 Think of it this way, once the variable b is no longer tethered to the
 old location specified by the older b, the garbage collector can't use it
 to find that older location in memory, and so can't gc it.
 
Also, you need to close all statements, resultsets, and connections when you're
done with them, and you can't just say ResultSet = new ResultSet and expect
the old one to die without being closed. It isn't collected until it's resources
it's using are freed, and that comes from the close() statement!




 How do unit build times work?
 
 Well, you'll notice the standard formula of 
 
 ticksPerUnit= (int) Math.round(300+1800*Math.exp(-Math.log(totalEngineers)/10));

Why do we do this? Well, we want an exponentially decreasing time as you build engineers,
so we make part of the ticks decreasable by having engineers. Now, engineers grow
proportional to the exp(average construction yard level), so if we put any number
over totalEngineers, like

Exp(-totalEngineers/somenumber) then very quickly it'll be outpaced, even if you
switch from somenumer=1800 to somenumber=50000 it only takes a few levels for
engineers to reach that. In order to set the characteristic average building level
where you should get .33 amplitude of the original 1800(e^-1 hits it to do this)
then you need to use the log of total engineers, which is the same thing as
taking the log(Exp(average construction yard level)) so that it's basically

Exp(-averageConstrLevel/10) This means when your average construction yard is
full and at lvl 10, you'll see a decay of 1800 by a factor of .33. So
by taking logs and using the bottom number, we can set the characteristic levels
of buildings where engineers make differences.

Why is this not done for building level up times? Let's take a look at the code 
from the getTicksForLevelingAtLevel(int lvlYouWant) method, as this gives
us samples of tick times for any level we ask about in a certain town:

	double nextLevelBase = (int) Math.round(300*Math.exp(lvlYouWant));
		double base = (int) Math.round(nextLevelBase/6.0);
		double expFactor = base*5;
		return (int) Math.round(base+expFactor*Math.exp(-totalEngineers/nextLevelBase));
		
As you can see, for whatever reason I thought of at the time,
nextLevelBase grows exponentially. totalEngineers does also.
		
Therefore, it's alright. Exp/Exp is a linear thing. That's why we don't change that!

We set basic trooper and citizen to be really low by level 10,
tanks by 15, juggers by 20, and bombers by 25, a nice and easy gradation!
(For once.)
		
		
 
 
 
 How do Queues work?
 
 Queues are for combat units only. The civilian units will be canceled separately.
 The AU-related fields on the building table shall be removed.
 
 Queue system is a new system. Buildings will now have IDs, and these
 will be foreign keys to Queues in the Queue table. A queue will have these fields:
AUtoBuild - AUslot of AU to build next.
AUCurrentTicks - Current ticks on the next au.
AUNumber - Number to Build
QueueID - Unique Queue ID
BID - Building ID

Each building will have an ArrayList of Queue objects that have these attributes.
When the system first loads up, it loads the most recent queue and begins processing it.
When a queue finishes(when AUNumber is 0 or cancelQueueItem is called) it is deleted
from the db and from the queue list. A the previous structure of having an array
of au units to build will be removed as it is now superfluous. This will be
the new medium.

List of things to do:

1. Alter the bldg table.---CHECK---
2. Create the queue table.---CHECK---
3. Create the queue object.---CHECK---
4. Alter Building to be able to add and remove queue objects as well as have different
data structures as per the queue way.---CHECK---
5. Alter the building server check method to work with this new system.---CHECK---
6. Alter God's loading and player's reading to work with the new system, player
does queue removal.. Remember, you only need
to ever update the topmost queue object! Use order by and shit too when getting
them out of God.---CHECK---
7. Change town's add/load bldg stuff.---CHECK---
8. BattlehardViewer fix.---CHECK---
9. BattlehardFunctions fix.---CHECK---

Tests that were done:
1. Try to queue up a single attack unit.---CHECK---
2. Queue up multiple attack units. See if it works as expected.---CHECK---
3. Queue up multiple attack units across multiple arms factories in the same town.---CHECK---
4. Same test but across different towns.---CHECK---
5. Same test but across different players. Can do all these tests by changing tid of buildings.---CHECK---
6. Try cancelling queue items.---CHECK---
7. Let one get pulled off naturally by ending.---CHECK---
8. Test across server restarts.---CHECK---







 
 How does the HQ Building work?
 
 Well, first off, you can only have one per city. It's level is the same
 amount of slots you can have out. A slot is taken if there are any
 outgoing/returning raids, and for any support units stationed elsewhere.
 The amount of unique townIDs for which you have support units stationed
 is the number of slots taken. 
 
 Of course, if an HQ building is bombed, then the player has more slots than allowed,
 but we'll let him. Eventually they'll come back and he'll no longer be able to use them!
 
 It should be noted that support unit recalls do not count towards your overall slot
 score. Why? Because a retreat is easily called, it doesn't require so much.
 
 So things that you need to do:
 1. Set up the if statement to make sure only one building can be made of the HQ variety.---CHECK---
 2. The slotsFree boolean method of the Town object needs to be made. It looks at
 the number of raids and the number of unique towns holding support units as well
 as the level of the HQ building(if present) to
 report back this boolean.---CHECK---
 3. Within the attack function which sends out all raids, and the resupply function,
 which helps out genocides/glassing, there needs to be an update to check slots
 and make sure they aren't greater than the level of the building.---CHECK---
 
 Tests done:
1. Try to send an attack with no HQ building.---CHECK---
2. Try to send more than 1 attack with lvl 1, more than 3 attacks with lvl 3.---CHECK---
3. Switch to player 3 and with a lvl 1 HQ try to send an attack - should be unable
due to support aus.---CHECK---





 
 
 
 How does the Bunker system work?
 
 The Bunker as a combat system is a series of algorithmic modifications
 on the BCE(Battlehard Combat Engine) that alter the flow
 of battle in favor of defense proportional to the amount and
 level of Bunkers present.
 
 This is only one part of the Bunker system, however.
 Bunkers have three different settings:
 1. Defense Mode
 2. VIP Mode
 3. Cache Mode
 
 Defense helps with combat, VIP protects civilians from
 genocide(and bombing) and cache mode protects resources. The amount of raw resources
 protected by a bunker needs to be the same across all modes. Also, bunkers
 need to not be easy to protect all and need to not protect all so people can take
 resources.
 
 Defense:
Bunker tech increases the protection a defensive bunker offers.
So, starting at 5% defensive increase, it can be ramped up to
like 50% over time with researches. This happens no matter
the bunker level. Increasing bunker level increases how many
soldiers are protected by this defensive increase. So providing protection is not
really the same thing as saving them entirely, it provides defensive boosts,
which go by bunker tech, but how many get defensive boosts is basically how many
you could buy with the warehouse. Similarly, with VIP, how many you get to protect
completely go by how many you could buy. So defensive mode is not as good as VIP mode, unless
VIP mode only really protects 5*bunkerTech% of what you could buy with the warehouse. That
means the other ones get slaughtered though, whereas with an army the protection is spread
and those units do not necessarily die. So we make the cap on bunkers the same, they go by
how much you could buy by full warehouse. This means effectively you're providing
protection to more soldiers than you could get with saved resources from the cache,
and preserving more civvies.

How many should be protected? I mean, you could protect
the aggregate cost of the building that you've put in so far,
but generally a bunker is a small, small % of your total economic output spent.
 Maybe what it should do is take your warehouse res for that level and calculate
 how many soldiers you could buy at max cap, and then protect that many. Of course you'll
 have to do n/how many slots are filled to get the right cost.
 

So how specifically does it work then? Each bunker is tagged with a peopleProtected
amount which is actually just whatever I choose rounded so we don't need to save anything,
however bunkers have a mode, which is 0,1, or 2, and 0 is defense mode.
So in combat, then, bunker frac would be whatever the bunkerTech said it was(1-.05*bunkerTech)
and then that fraction should be diminished proportional to the fraction of the total army
size the total bunker protection offers. So like, if the bunker supports 250 people,
then the army size being 500 means that only 1/2 of the army should be protected. 

How do we do this? If it were the whole army, bunker frac should be .95 if bunkerTech is 1,
but since it's half the army, each set of units should only get half of the protection,
so .975 instead. Instead of protecting half of the units and not protecting the other
half, the algorithm spreads the .05% that would goto 250 over 500 so it becomes .025%.

So the formula for bunker frac is


bunkerfrac=(1-.05*bunkerTech*armysizefrac)

where armyfrac is

Sigma(exp(lvl), each bunker)/totalArmyExpmodsize or 1 if armyfrac>1.

Add (lvl-25)*Exp(25) if lvl is above 25 for soft limit on bunkers.

This minimizes damage done. Armysizefrac can be calculated at the beginning
of the raid.

The VIP mode works like so:

In the event of a genocide, the total number protected over the town pop or 1 if this is greater
than 1 is the fraction of
each building that IS NOT let out into genocide.

Similarly, when pplbombing occurs with the bombLogic, the people in a building
can be killed but ONLY down to the fraction that the bunker protects, or 1,
if it's greater.

VIP mode takes the number that you can fit in the cap in the equations
and does n/3, because the cost of the amount of civvies you can hold
sort of gets divided by three since there are three types, and bunker
mode provides protection across all units already so they distribute
properly.

Resource mode works like:

So basically you should only be able to save a percentage of warehouses at the same level.
Let's say it starts at 5% of the warehouse res at the same level. Then you can upgrade
your bunker tech and get 25%, 35%, and so on. So you can turtle up. It is possible to do. 

And then while soldiers get 5% of full warehouse cap res protected max, you get 5%
of full warehouse cap res protected in cache mode, the only uneven is that civvies
get wholly protected all the way up to the cap. How do we fix that? Only protect 5% of them?

That means each level up you get, you get 5*bunkertech% protected by each of the modes
of the warehouse cap at that level. So we max out at 50% - you need two bunkers to get it all for res,
whereas with troops it just expands your max amount protectable, but with civvies literally
does double protection.

To clarify:
1. Leveling up bunker means at the new level's warehouse cap, however many soldiers you could buy,
you must give 5*bunkerTech% to them.
2. Leveling up your bunker means at the level's warehouse cap, however many civilians you could buy,
you must protect 5*bunkerTech% of them.
3. Leveling up your bunker means at the level's warehouse cap, you must protect 5*bunkerTech% of those res.

To implement this new formula:
1. Change combat for civvies and armies, probably going to have to make a battlehard function
that returns hwo many units you can build given 400 and 100 base unit prices.---CHECK---
2. Change the effect strings.---CHECK---
3. Change the res saved in the moveResources formula accordingly.
4. Change the res saved in the moveResources formula according to cargo change below.
make sure THE ZERO CASE WHEN YOU HIT ZERO PLAYERS ALLOWS FOR ALL!
5. CHANGE ARMS FACTORY IMPROVEMENTS TOO!---CHECK---

The formula for units saved is gonna be resourceAmt*exp(lvl+1)/((70/4)n/(unitsallowable))*(n/(unitsallowable)+1)/2
(the 70 comes from summing the total res and then you divide by four, units allowable is how ever many attack
unit slots you have filled or three for civvies!)

Corresponding Cargo change: 
To account for the low protection rating and high cargo capacity of units and with
brushes being generally nonlethal to incoming soldiers, we either make it so you only
take cargo if you win the fight(% wise) or your cargo is drastically reduced.

so if you lose the fight, the percentage you lost by is the cargo you can take,
whereas if you win the fight, you can take your normal cargo. If you make it weighted,
so you get more cargo percentage if you win, then players will try to crush others
before taking cargo - if you make it normal, then they will just try to outnumber the other
guy slightly, to be forced not to get the drastically reduced cargo. 

I have an idea. You first allow them to take as much as possible, but then you multiply that
by (your%lost-their%lost)*afTech*.05, so afTech gets evened out here! The max of course would be
grabbing 100% of your loot, the minimum, 0. And this cannot be won by sending high cargo,
this must be won by straight winning the battle.


Arms factories not equal?

True you get their benefit across all your raids, but generally at home when you get hit
your whole army is contributing to the fight, whereas with 10 raids out only 1/10 of your army
is in each one, so while they'll likely get more protection overall sent out in a little bits
than having your army at home and seeing that the bunker can't hold them, bunkers counter
this by being able to protect other types of stuff. The fact that you can protect roughly as many
res as you can take, due to this fix and the fact that people generally only win by 1% or so in battles,(so
5-10% for an AF of 1), means res mode and AF cargo cancel out, AF protection and bunker mode do not cancel out
but bunkers also protect civvies so there is that, something AF does not do in any capacity.


To-do list to make it happen then is:

1. Add a new field to bldgs called bunker setting.---CHECK---
2. Add a new field to player called bunkerTech.---CHECK---
3. Alter the combat system to detect how many bunkers, how much
they contribute, etc, and make a bunkerfrac.---CHECK---
4. Alter the combat system's genocide protocols to not take out
civilians below the bunker limits decided in the document above.---CHECK---
5. Alter the pplbombing part of bombLogic so that it can't kill
more than the bunker limit.---CHECK---
6. Alter resource taking so that resources cannot be taken below
the limit(1/4th the formula for resources above, so 25 instead of 100
for each.)---CHECK---
7. Implement the changeBunkerMode() method in battlehardfunctions.---CHECK---
8. Test and debug this shit.

Tests done:
1. Set it up so bunkerfrac gets printed for every following instance.
Create one bunker and set it on combat mode lvl x and make there be more
soldiers than that, let's see if bunker frac protects correctly - ie, for 2x
soldiers, there should be a .975 frac since 2.5% is taken off instead of 5%,
and for 1x, should just be 5%. For 4x, should be 5/4%. ---CHECK---
2. Turn on VIP mode and try a genocide. Make sure x, the number of people,
is half the total, so half get taken out of each. Then try the whole numbered
one. And so forth. ---CHECK---
3. Send a strafing with a pplbomber. See if when x is half of the total, only
half get bombed, then when it is the total, etc.---CHECK---
4. Set it to resource mode and try to move resources beyond the resource limit
which should print and see what happens.---CHECK---
5. Try having one vip bunker and one combat bunker and seeing how the two are
affected in a genocide.---CHECK---
6. Try seeing what happens with a glassing.---CHECK---
7. Try choosing an improper mode or with an improper building just to test
the change function out.---CHECK---
8. Make sure that bunkerModes and bunkerTechs are maintained across server restarts.---CHECK---





 How does bomb target order get changed?
 
 Very simple, do changeTarget(int raidID, int newTarget).
 
 Tests:
1. Send out a strafe and try and change the target.---CHECK---
2. Try to change the strafe target post raid.---CHECK---
3. Try to change an attack bomb target.---CHECK---




 
Genocide-Glassing Civilian Support Policies:

Civilians are not supporting units. They will be saved in additional
unused columns for in the bldg entry when they
are out for genocide. They will then be read in again if the size is not -1. This
preserves them across restarts. We put it in bldg because this auto-keeps track
of different engineering attack unit types due to multiple copies of the same
building!---CHECK---

They do not gain veterancy via a new if statement on their lotNums!=-1.---CHECK---

Finally, they will remain outside until all of the genocides that are attacking
that city that have allClear booleans have either been recalled or are over. This will
be done by a special method called checkForGenocides(Town argument) in the player object that
searches for civilian units and, if found, searches for genocides currently on-going.
Normally, genocides put back civvies if they lose, but in the case of a recall,
then this never occurs, so this method will then do that for us. If there
are other incoming genocides that haven't hit yet(and thus have no allClear)
then those civilians still go back inside...that'd allow someone to keep
sending and recalling a genocide to keep citizens outside!---CHECK---

If a genocide is beaten, then it should not remove civilian au unless checkForGenocides
is false.---CHECK---

If a genocide hits and there is already an allClear genocide hitting that city,
then it's allClear variable is automatically turned on. This will be started
before the raid even begins by simply looking to see if it's a genocide,
finding if there are any others with allClear on, and then going with that.---CHECK---

Is it possible to add supportAU, then have them still be there after civilians
are added? No. Civilians should always be for the most part right after
the original attacking au but we'll think on this and prepare.

Is it possible that two attackServer run throughs from separate players that land at the
same tick will add civilian units at the same time, duplicating them? No,
because one will set it to zero before the other.

Tests done:
1. Send an attack out with support au and recall the support au and see
if the raid retains it's data structures and raidSupportAU after
the recall via a print out function and a select * call. This is important
in the assumptions I make. It won't hurt this method but it's a small test
and could eliminate a future issue. I made an adjustment in the support code for this.---CHECK---
2. Test genocide across a server restart and see that civilians are MAINTAINED.---CHECK---
3. Test that when one genocide enters a town when another is there already and allClear is on,
it also puts on allClear and doesn't add anymore civilians.---CHECK---
4. Recall a Genocide raid before it ends and see if the civilians disappear.---CHECK---
5. Change veterancy listings to show which units are getting veterancy so you can see
if civilians get it.---CHECK---
6. Test that scouting runs during genocides do not give info on civilian units.---CHECK---
7. Two genocides, one incoming, while the other does its work and fails
Civilians are returned to their posts.---CHECK---





 How does glassing/genocide resupply work?
 
 Via the resupply(raidID,auAmts[],yourTownName) function. You can only
 resupply from the originating town as supportAU MAY be different.
 
 What will it do? It'll either have resupplyID on raid =-1 for normal attacks
 or it'll be something real for resupplies, which is how we'll tell.
 
 Beauty is don't have to worry about adding new aus during the other's attack,
 they're both on the same attackServer so they're never being processed
 at the same time!
 
 Tests:

1. Send out a genocide raid on a city with citizens and soldiers so that
it hits the first time, followed by a resupply that'll hit right after
and resupply, without support units.---CHECK---
2. Do it with support units.---CHECK---
3. Try to send non-offsupport units.---CHECK---
4. Recall that resupply...---CHECK---
 
 
 
 
 How does raid-recall work?
 
 You type raidRecall(RID), which then searches through your attack servers
 until it finds it and returns it. Couple this a new user object type
 called userRaid, which is in the battlehard functions package and
 contains an integer array of au sizes and an au string array with their names,
 as well as a destination string, x, y, a starting point string and x,y, 
 and a raid ID.
 
 When the user types userRaid holdRaids[] = returnRaids(townName), then it
 returns an array of these objects. Then one can be used to do raidRecall.
 
 Tests for recall:
1. See if you can get data on all of your raids, using (preferably) player 2 after
fucking stalling that invasion raid. Specifically, have it print out a toString
or something.---CHECK---
2. See if you can then do it with player 1 and recall that horrendous 159 raid coming
in.---CHECK---
 
 
 
 
 Six different types of AU all build at the same time...so what does one get for
 specializing in one unit and paying that extra build time(factor of six for same
 number of units)?
 
 Okay, so if you build one unit, you incur price restrictions, in exchange
 you get veterancy.
 
 If you build six units, you build a lot faster than building one unit(by a factor
 of six) but you DO NOT get veterancy AND you do not incur price restrictions AND
 with cargo you get the same improvement as having 6 units with 6 spread.
 
 What we do to fix this is set up a "chooser" in each Arms Factory that lets
 the user choose which units get developed...or change that into a new
 table of queues referencing tids and building slot numbers, followed by
 queue ID which will increase over time. You'd load them onto a stack
 on each building and this would be a lot more data. Better to leave this one.
 
 Besides, you want people to DIVERSIFY their armaments. The best way to do this
 is to promote it. Therefore, people will on average have MANY units, with only
 a few going for veterancy. Veterancy also just changes fight turnouts in a sort
 of luck related fashion, and does reward those who build a lot of a certain type
 of unit.
 
 
 
 
 
 How does createPlayer method work?
 See the documentation there.
 From your journal:
Made a createPlayer method in God...you'd need to set up a separate channel to listen
for requests, but that can be done later, the prototype is there and ready
for testing when you are, when you implement it in the battlehardviewer,
it's just getting the paperwork ready.

 Possible New God setup for Alpha to Beta:
 
 Alright so I'm thinking...how to fit more players on.
 
 We create an event LIST in the game...all events have
 pids attached, attacker, defenders, support pids, everything,
 and there are different types of events:
 
 Raid Events
 Building Events
 Trading Events
 
 etc.
 
 This table records the timestamp of creation and the number of ticks until a synchronize
 takes place due to this event and this event is removed when it's used
 to create a synchronize...
 
 When a user signs on, he selects all events concerning him that should
 have happened already
 and sends "synchronize" signals to all of the other players
 that may be out there...and a player that is logged on will suddenly resynchronize,
 also any player that logs on auto-synchronizes with logon. This puts
 the processor on the user's computer to work.
 
 The events will have timestamps and seconds left, so that it can be seen that
 an event has passed and synchronization needs to occur. The iterate() function
 will need to be used repeatedly so that if a raid has landed and then another
 5 seconds later, iterate is called 5 times before the second raid is processed.
 
 PlayerScript will become a new subAI, which will have each of the old players
 on it, that's the problem, if they exist, the players need to exist on the
 server and be easily writable, or else we rewire battlehard functions
 to just place events on the server table and use query statements to assemble
 player objects on the go...probably best to assemble a player object, and then
 every time a function is called, the table is checked against time to see if sync
 is needed, then the player object syncs, then the function goes through and
 does stuff.
 
 In this way, almost all of the processing occurs on the user end, my server
 just contains a database. The only processing it needs to do is the programs
 the users write.
 
 How could we make this work? Well, firstly, we get rid of God. We make
 it so that when the user signs on, he loads his player, and all events with
 calculated "negative ticks" (we keep the old data tables but all "ticks" stuff
 is stored on a single event table) we process, starting with the earliest event
 and iterating in between negative tick intervals, doing all the processing
 on the facsimile players - also loading up any other players required to run the
 data. By loading them up, however, we also have to load them up, and in loading them
 up, we may have to load another up...and that guy may need you to load up, but you
 can't without calling the other guy...okay maybe come back to look at this in some
 time.
 
 
 Well there are a limited number of events. I guess what you need to do is
 select all events associated with your pid, and then for every pid associated,
 select all pid associated with them, and so on, until you get a list of pids
 that need loading. Then, you load them all up on the user's computer at once,
 turn them on, and then do processing based on negative ticks backup. Then after
 all events are processed IN ORDER in each player, every one being iterated
 in between events, then the resultant data 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 How does Invasion work?
 
 Right, well, basically we shouldn't do it on comparison
 to population as that will be easy to do. What we should do is
 add townTech and if you have room you can take another town.
 
 The restriction should be that the HQ and all Bunkers must be destroyed
 before a town is taken over. Then Invasion can work if the army
 is some percentage of the population. Also, HQ as a building
 needs to be coded in and can only be built once per city.
 
 checklist to make invasion work:
 
 1. Create the HQ building type and make sure it cannot be built if there is one
 already in town. This is the only building like this. Also make HQ
 scoutable by updating that code.---CHECK---
 2. Create the invasion boolean on raid table and in raid object that
 is preserved. Make it so the attack() command can send and understand it.---CHECK---
 3. Make the invasionLogicBlock that checks to see if bunkers/HQs exist
 and if they don't then check to see that the army is at least twice
 the population of the town(expMod should be used instead of popSize,
 as then the larger attack units are better for invasion.) If
 the prospects check out, then the town needs to be removed from one player
 and put on another with the giveTown method.---CHECK---
 4. Create the giveTown method---CHECK---
 5. Implement the invasionLogicBlock into attackServer by placing it in the
 combat logic block, as one of the if-handlers at the end. if(invade) is
 fairly easy enough and no other combat types will have that!!!.---CHECK---
 6. Status Reports need to be created and read.---CHECK---
 7. Make the giveTown method to give towns away, and make
 a player called "Id" that holds all the other towns that aren't
 held by players. Unocc. ---CHECK---
 8. Make it so the viewer switches to home town with a town is lost!
 This hometown will exist no matter what because synchronize will
 only be called once the new town is given if it's the last one...
 
 Invasion Testing:
In all testing, place support units in attack and defending positions...
And make sure there is always something building in multiple buildings,
Make sure a few buildings on building server
Few harmless raids on raid server. ---CHECK---

1. Try to take player2's town2 using player1's forces, with military at home.---CHECK---
2. Try to take town2 with forces that do not meet the invasion reqs. Shouldn't work...---CHECK---
3. Add a bunker to town2, but strip of units, try to invade.---CHECK---
4. Bunker added, but with units too, try to invade.---CHECK---
5. Try to take player3's town, only town, see if it gives the new city correctly!---CHECK---
6. Change all ID's towns to player2, and try to take player3's town, see if it sends
the raid back!---CHECK---
 
 
 
 
 
 How does scouting work?
 
Let's make it simple. We know that stealthTech will only be able to go
up to a certain amount.

What determines what you see?

There are different levels of scouting, later levels include all data in previous levels:
1. You see names and troop numbers in a town.
2. You see resources.
3. You see civilian numbers.
4. You see building amounts and levels.
5. You see attack unit type data of units that have size>0.

You can never see research chosen by the player, or attack units not
present at that city! Can you see support units? Sure can!

How do we know what type of report is shipped? Easy!

If your stealth technology is lower, then you can only receive level 1 reports.
If your stealth technology is higher, then you receive the difference in stealth
technologies as the level of report that you receive. 


IF SUPPORT UNITS ARE SCOUTING, SHOULDN'T THEIR STEALTH TECH BE USED? No.
Then nobody would build tech except for one guy who would loan them units.

Right so now it's time for the new one. Scout tech and concealment v stealth and accuracy.
Accuracy will need to be modified by the units like concealment is because we're using soldiers.

So basically we need to go by the Sa/Sd ratio for what type of report you get. And you need
to be something like

((1+.05*scout)*avgConc)/((1+.05*stealth)*averageAcc)*cos^2(1-(yours)/(cover))/sin^2(theirs/cover). 

So if this is under 1, then we take a random number and if it is say...above
the number and under 1(which it will be) they get caught.

If more than one, we set up the tiered thing we know of.

You can see how the tech would be quite useful. But then we also need
to somehow include that sending in large numbers MAY get you more info but
you have a greater chance of getting caught...

We could use cover in this? Yeah. Let's use cover, it's kind of cool.

Except make it signficantly lower...multiply this by an exponential with their
army size somehow decreasing the chance or something. How about...

sin^2(x)?

so what is this x? It's got to be somehow related to their Cover and troop size
and your troop size.

1-(yours)/(cover)? So if they have far over the limit, harder to hit the sweetspot.

Then multiplied by

1-(theirs/cover). So if they're way below, it really hurts you, and similarly, if they're
way above, it really hurts you.


So the special amount is there. You can sacrifice more to get more info.







Scout Logic Block:

3. Calculate effective concealment as per the combat system(copy/paste.)
5. Calculate the final limit and a random number.
6. If the random number is => limit, send a status report.
7. Status report is level 1 if theirs is greater, yours-theirs if lesser.
8. Status reports are sent by
	1. using offNames for their unit names,
	2. auoffst for their troop numbers, civilians can be included here for level 2.
	3. auofffi can hold their stats and weapons held.
	4. audefnames can hold building names  
	5. audefst can hold their numbers.
	6. m,t,mm, and f fields in a stat report can hold resources.
	
Of course, if the difference is greater than 5 then they see everything!

List of things to do:
1. Modify raid table and data structure to include the scout boolean(loadin,loadout,etc)---CHECK---
2. Modify combat part and statreps to include integer scout variable in statreps
so that if combat comes, then when the raid is reconfigured and goes through as a
combat run, it will show up in stat reports as a scouting run gone awry.---CHECK---
3. Modify stat reports to display bad scouting runs.---CHECK---
4. Modify attack() to be able to send out scouting parties.---CHECK---
5. Create scout logic block and else if statement on attack server check.---CHECK---
6. Create ability to read scout reports.---CHECK---






 Why do we scale the cargo?
 
 We know that the standard soldier carries 50 cargo,
 The standard soldier has a base cost of 80 resources. This means that at a certain army size,
 cargo taken will be nothing compared to unit costs...which will make pillaging kind of
 useless as far as everyone else goes.
 
 So there is that formula number*(number+1)/2.
 ...so that total cargo scales up to the size of the attack! This means
 larger attacks are better if you intend to take a lot because soldiers can work together
 to carry more back.
 
 This number could be size*popSize, because
 Their popSize is 5, 10, and 20. With popSize used instead,
Juggernaughts get 4x cargo generally and a 10x increase to their size number(size*popSize)
leading to a 40x cargo boost relative to soldiers, and they are worth 40 soldiers.
Tanks do 2x the cargo and 5x their size leading to a 10x cargo boost. But this isn't
entirely true, each one of those 10 soldiers adds an extra multiplicative, whereas
the juggernaught is just straight up one thing. However, Juggernaught prices' include
the little addups made.

 If each unit contributes separately
 but then we get into grouping the same unit giving more advantages.
 
 So what we do is sum up all their cargos and all their sizes and then do the formula
 above on the entire cargo loadout.

However, if you have 1 of each of three combat aus, it'll add like they were
all bought as the same au and so had a triple price increase when this didn't happen.
This makes it more lucrative to split up unit types and not use only one. Okay.
I can work with that.
 
 So, to overview:
 
 Prices rise like base 80 * 1, then 80 * 2, etc.
 
 Cargo rises like 50 * 1, then 50*2, etc, roughly. So you can quickly
 reimburse units by raiding.


 
 
 
 
 
 How does concealment work in offensive, vs defensive, situations?
 
it takes twice as much concealment to launch a good offensive attack than a defensive one.
Can be fixed later but would be a good rule of thumb: Twice the concealment for offense.
Not what I'd prefer, but it basically means that the army you can attack with at a certain concealment rating on a town
of similar population is half the army you can defend with and get the same rating. It also means
attacking armies that are large relative to the village size will suffer for it, leading to small armies against
small villages, large armies against large villages, and a need to reconnoiter everything. Cool!
							
							
							
							
							
							

 How do supporting armies work?
 
 6. Implement supporting armies, and make sure they can attack if they are flagged to do so.(Also you must be able to support, not just receive.)

What's the best way to do this?

We need to maintain always the town origin of the armies. So do we send them on the raid server?
sure, why not. We keep track of their slots, sure, but we shouldn't use this to define anything.
We remove them from the raid and add them to the aus of the town they were sent to. Then we
can send raids with them. The attackserver itself doesn't care how many there are...but the database
code does. We need to come up with a way to add this stuff. Maybe a single extra string for extra
aus in every place.

Players can send their own aus to support anywhere. They cannot, however, send other player's aus
to support anywhere. They can send them to attack, though, and return to their original set
position.

CHECKLIST TO MAKE IT HAPPEN:

 
Tests done:
1. Set supportTech = 1, try to transfer 100 soldiers and see what gets sent back. Make sure population of town it's going to
is 100.---CHECK---
2. Same test, transfer 7 soldiers.---CHECK---
3. Set supportTech = 3, try to transfer 100 soldiers, then 30 soldiers.---CHECK---
4. Keeping supportTech = 3, create a three new players, give them each 100 soldiers, and with one town,
and try to send them to player2's one town. See if you get 30% on each.---CHECK---
5. Keeping supportTech = 3, recall one of the soldier units from player2.---CHECK---
6. Try to send two support runs - 15 soldiers and 15 soldiers.---CHECK---
7. Load the player2 up with 2 players' worth of support and then
do an attack on him, view results. Are they within expectations?---CHECK---
8. Knock out a support unit(if you didn't already) and view what happens to the support AU in memory and
elsewhere.---CHECK---
9. Send player2's support units to attack player1, with their own units, and then without. Does it work?---CHECK---
10. Recall all units after all of this and see if we can recreate the peace.---CHECK---
11. Test that support is retained across server restarts.---CHECK---
12. Test that support raids are retained across server restarts.---CHECK---
13. Kill only part of the units and see if it adjusts supportAU table.---CHECK---

(This checklist can also then be modified to explain how supporting armies work.)
View this checklist as an instruction key on HOW to make supporting raids happen,
this is what had to be done, you can find these steps located in the program, because this
is such a diffuse topic, it is not linear and therefore defies a straightforward explanation.
Instead rely on this list of changes to understand where and why.


Foreign AUs are kept in a separate table called "support" with foreign key tid and has columns:---CHECK---
Foreign tid(foreign key)[Can also get player from here.]
tid(foreign key)
real slot num of attackunit in the foreign player's arsenal
 slot number of this player's arsenal
 size of unit

All attackunits will now have a "support" integer, that when 1, means that
it is a support unit, 2 is an offensive support unit, 0 means it is not a
support unit. It then has an holdOriginalSlot number that is used
for the foreign player's original slot. It does not need to remember foreign tids,
the db server can do that..---CHECK---

When they go through a fight, when removeAU is called, it will detect the support boolean
and remove from the other player.---CHECK---

Removing foreign aus is a difficult business, because one must check the raid server
AND the town they came from for zero before removal.---CHECK---

Player will now have "support tech" associated with it that determines how many
players can have supporting armies in a location and support density tech
which determines what percentage of your army size they can have there. Actually
we can combine these to make it easier - each level adds a slot and a percentage of
like 10% of population size. Or maybe allow only 50% max of your army size, and then
they can upgrade slots. But if it's 1 slot 10%, then 2 slots 20% each, 3 slots 30% each,
it's a researchable skill. And it doesn't change the game much.---CHECK---

Raid objects need a support integer attached, meaning they are a support raid. As it
is not commonly used, it doesn't need to be included in the load up constructor.
It will need to be included in the new Raid constructor, though.  Instead,
you can use the makeSupportRun() or makeOffSupportRun() method when loading up from a
dead DB. This includes changes to the DB to hold this integer.---CHECK---

attack() will have to be modified to allow for variable length arrays for sending
these units. Right so to send a raid that is support, there needs to be support codes:
"support" means defense
"offsupport" means defensive and offensive capabilities.---CHECK---

attackServerCheck will do the detecting on incoming support units, any units that
go beyond the limits will be sent back as a separate return raid object. See
procedural overview comments on this in the attackServerCheck code for this piece. This will
also generate a support status report that both parties can view.---CHECK---

Stat reports will now carry the boolean support, which is by default false.
If it is present, then offNames will be names of unit,
auoffst will be units sent, auoffi will be units sent back.
defst and deffi will be left blank and stuff. Stat reports will display the
report similarly.---CHECK---

When the user attacks with
support units, each supporter will receive a copy of the battle report.
-Do this by..well it searches tid1, tid2...so basically, you use supportAU table,
and say, do I have any units that share a tid with me on that table? If so,
what are their ftids? Get them all and then query all stat reports
with that ftid. ---CHECK---

Veterancy will have to be modified by searching out the OTHER player's stuff.
-What, specifically, needs modification? The totalPopulation count.
We can use originalPlayer in an if statement for this. ---CHECK---

recall() which will recall all units from a specific city. This method will eventually work on raids
also. ---CHECK---

Make it so users cannot build or modify units that are in slots > slot 6(or 5 on 0 based indexing.)---CHECK---

God needs to be able to read all of this in.---CHECK---

Player needs to be able to write all of this out, specifically, updating supportAU
table as called..---CHECK---

raidSupportAU needs to be created to store values of sAU on
raids. How this works: When attackunits are added beyond the sixth,
they are added to raidSupportAU table by add method in Raid, and
updated by player for all >6 aus. God reads in support AUs for each
raid from raidSupportAU table after
it makes the raid and puts in au for it, and then adds copies of them
from the town which has them. This does not effect defensive support AUs!
That's the supportAU table, which requires ftids and other stuff
that we can save space on if we do not use these in raidSupportAU.---CHECK---

Make stat reports do a separate defending line and offending line every six units. That'll make it easy to
see.---CHECK---







 Do 4 tanks = 1 Jugger as expected?
 
 Yeah. They do. Because 10 soldiers = 1 tank and 40 soldiers = 1 Juggernaught. Perfect math.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 How does the Veterancy system work?
 
  Probably best to randomly choose to get protection or a damage boost.
 
 So what can we do to spur on veterancy? What defines it? Should it be time used, amount made, or what?
 I'm not about using amount made, because this number rises exponentially. I can't use the percentage of the
 combat unit population it has, because people get 100% veterancy with only one unit. I can't use time,
 because then the server has got to measure dates and stuff, which is NOT what I want.
 
Veterancy is defined by the formula:

randomdecimal*expModOfAllSuchUnit*.5/totalPopWithExpMod

totalPopWithExpMod, includes combat units. So veterancy really isn't determined by the time that the units have
existed, or by the time the unit type has existed, so it's kind of a misnomer. It's just assumed that a user
wouldn't be able to generate an army of sizeable amount compared to his population very quickly, since
his population was built over time and cost so much to make. So it's an indirect measure of time.

So the problem here is that totalPop uses popSize, not expMod, and expMod is generally> than pop for
units...which means you could get veterancy fracs over 1 which is unacceptable. A fix is to
use the sum of all town populations + the sum of all unit populations in each town*expmod, and
we use this instead via a certain method, findPopWithExpMod or something along those lines.

If the user had genocide committed on his people, then he wouldn't have much in the way of military units, but if
he did have one last protected city, those units there would get the huge boost. I guess they should be fighting like hell.

So once we have the veterancy "limit" as described above, we can make a veterancyfrac that hits both the damage on
the defensive and offensive units that makes the damage increase or decrease, and we need to subtract the offensive
and defensive contributions due to their respective veterancies to get the total veterancy frac.

For instance, if offensive gets an off boost, defensive a def boost, then 1-offboost+defboost = vetfrac for
the defenders. If off gets no off boost, but defensive, then it's just 1-0+defboost. See?

In bombing, the formulae should remain the same. Veterancy shouldn't affect bombers more than other units.

How about popSize*size? We're using this in the number of units thing, right? Ideally, yeah.

So then is it fair? Tanks get like a popSize of 5, but an expMod of 10. So which do we use?
Is it really right to give tanks a factor of five advantage on gaining veterancy to soldiers?

Well given that one tank is equal to ten soldiers, then ten soldiers get twice the veterancy
of a tank using popSize. So we actually need to use expMod. Then ten soldiers are as
powerful as a tank/get the same veterancy.






What is the deal with expMod v popSize?

expMod can be qualified as "How much the unit is worth in combat value terms of soldiers."
It is also how it appears to the outside worth - how much is that unit worth in every
way in terms of combat value?

popSize can be qualified as "How much the unit costs in people to operate."
This is how many people are actually operating the unit - but the tech
the unit has may make this conglomeration of people worth more than say
four soldiers.

expMod really is more useful, popSize is just sort of a bitch move to make stuff work out.
I dunno. I just know that it all adds up for what I want to do with two variables, popSize and expMod,
and expMod seems to work for comparisons of unit sizes.

popSize came about because this is how much population a unit is worth - it helps determine
  the multiplier of the damage done by a unit,
 and the proportion of damage that a unit receives. The reason
I don't get rid of this in favor of expmod is that expmod too large a damage modifier in the damage equations to work out properly.

expMod is for exponential advantages, so that the number of soldiers it takes to kill a tank
do not get any exponential advantage on the tank(expmod is 10 for tank as opposed to 5(it's popSize) to make this happen.)

Expmod can also be used with veterancy to guarantee ten soldiers get the same veterancy as the 1 tank they kill.
It is also used with support calculations - since 1 tank = 10 soldiers, expmod is used to determine
relative sizes of units in comparison with each other to figure out a fair way to interchange between them
with balancing support armies. That is, if popSize is used, 2 tanks = 10 soldiers by a support maxSize's
count, but if expMod is used, 1 tank = 10 soldiers. See?





 How does population get counted?
 
 Many methods change peopleInside and AU sizes. But they don't change the things that keep track of them.
 
 Here is an overview of track variables:
 So there is a total variable for each unit - messengers and scholars are player wide,
 engineers and traders local to cities.
 
 Res[4] in each city is the city's civilian pop.
 
 Total population is all civilians+all combat units(combat units not in size but in popSize.)
 
 removePeople method is great for getting rid of people in buildings, not aus.
 
 removeAU does remove AUs.
 
 As AUs are only kept track of in totalPopulation, we do not ever change it except when they are lost,
 whether or not they are on raids. We remove population at the end of every attack server round according to the unit
 amount lost. Buildingserver is the only thing that adds population, and it does it whenever new things are built.
 When a building is destroyed, it calls removePeople to adjust the population. Similarly, when levelDown is called,
 and the building IS NOT destroyed, it also removes people.
 
 Finally, if the bomb logic detects that people have died, it removes the difference also.
 
 So a quick list of things that change population:
 1. Bldgserver(aus+people)
 2: Attack server(aus)
 3. Bombing logic block(people)
 4. levelDown(people)
 5. killBuilding(people)
 
 
 
 
 
 How does bombing as an option work?
 
 Well you must understand that there are two ways to do this:
 1. As an extension to genocide, require that it only commence bombing after
 all offensive units are destroyed, and it'd keep going until it killed everything or was called back.
 	-In this case, each bomb could have offensive characteristics, each one moving from ppl bomb down
 	to bldg bomb tier 3-tier1.
 2. As an extra option - each attack run results in both normal damage and bombing damage. Then people
 could do a genocide bombing type deal or a single attack or what have you.
 3. As two separate options: Coupled with genocide, it does complete annihilation. Coupled with attack,
 it does a single strafing run.
 	-This would have to work by performing bombing calculations after each attack, and modifying the genocide
 	if statements to include in the number of defensive units left standing the number of bldgs and or people...
 	
 	We could do the final one, and separate into options:
 	1. Attack
 	2. Genocide
 	3. Glass(Genocide+Bombing to the ground)
 		-Would use full bombing ability, but only after a clearing of the area. Uses 25% while under normal conditions.
 	4. Strafing Run(Attack+Bomb.)
 		-Would only use 25% of bombing ability, but can be done in a strafing run.
 		-Just like how you lose 75% of resources in glassing.
 	
 	In this case the codes would be "glass" and "strarun" in the program.
 
 What are the mechanics of bombing? How are they calculated?
 
 Well clearly each bomb should do some percentage of damage to in-building civilians and the buildings themselves.
 
 The Nova Bomb does tier 3 average damage to combat units
 HM does tier 2
 Hive does tier 1
 
 As for their effects on buildings, this'll clearly have to be proportional to the number of bombers.
 Do we want the number of bombersxprice of bombers = price of level to take down? This would give us
 a good estimate on how many bombers it'd take to take down a level. We have the return price method, which
 will return the price of new units, but we could also figure out the price for the current units - though
 some may have been lost in previous battles, diminishing the overall value of the current set.
 Also this would not be an exact number - different numbers of bombers from different players could
 take down the same level building. I guess that they should at least have enough so that if they
 were at the BASE amount of bombers(0) and built up to a certain number x, that number x and price y
 should, multiplied together, equal the price of the building's level.
 
 Then, it doesn't matter when they bought it, we set 0 arbitrarily. This is, after all, the cheapest
 way to do it - it's gonna mean a lot more bombers are required. Let's look at some numbers:
 
 Since we arbitrarily set bomber price at 20x the soldier price, we can use this as a starting point.
 One bomber costs 80*20=1600 resources.
 
 The next bomber costs 3200. And so on...we know that buildings cost their cost array * exp(lvl).
 
 We can sum that up. Building cost is around 400. And rises like Math.pow(lvl+1,2+.03(lvl+1)).
 
 So we've got number of bombers required >= 400*Math.pow(lvl+1,2+.03(lvl+1))/(price of bombers)
 
 
 price of bombers = 1400*y*(y+1)/2. Where y is number of bombers.
 
 1400*y^2*(y+1)/2 = 400*Math.pow(lvl+1,2+.03(lvl+1))
 
 bomberprice*(y^3 + y^2)/2 = bldgprice*Math.pow(lvl+1,2+.03(lvl+1))
 
	(y^3 + y^2) = 2*bldgprice*Math.pow(lvl+1,2+.03(lvl+1))/bomberprice
	
	(y^3 + y^2) - 2*bldgprice*Math.pow(lvl+1,2+.03(lvl+1))/bomberprice=0;
	run:
 NSolve[y^3 + y^2 - 8*(l + 1)^(2 + .03 (l + 1))/14 == 0, y] ==> make l the level.
So we need to solve this cubic. As this equation essentially applies to every lvl, we should
calculate it in advance and list the price table here:

So bldgprice*2/(bomberprice) = 400*2/1400 = 8/14. So let's do a calculation table here then for

	(y^3 + y^2) - 8*Math.pow(lvl+1,2+.03(lvl+1))/14=0;
 using mathematica and print it out. But there is more to this theory.

SEE BNR FOR THE NUMBERS ON THIS EQN

y = (1/3)*(-1 - Math.pow(2,2/3)/Math.pow((4 - 27*Math.exp(lvl) + 3*Math.sqrt(3)*Math.sqrt(-8*Math.exp(lvl) + 27*Math.exp(2*lvl))),(
   1/3)) - Math.pow((4 - 27*Math.exp(lvl) + 3*Math.sqrt(3)*Math.sqrt(-8*Math.exp(lvl) + 27*Math.exp(2*lvl))),(
   1/3))/Math.pow(2,(2/3)));
   
   This generates nonreal numbers. Java cannot handle them and any work arounds are incredibly memory intensive, and also nearly
   impossible to debug. Fucking Java. Possible workarounds:
   
   1. Use a different equation to determine bombers.
   2. Hardwire in the levels.
   
   Thoughts of 1:
   	-No direct price-to-damage correlation between building levels lost and bombers required. Then again,
   	people may not be sending the entire fleet anyway so this is kind of an arbitrary choice of price basis.
   	They may send only the top 10% and those bombers cost a shitton more than if you just built that amount from the
   	start. Price is really not a good indicator. Maybe a straight up exp function would do?
   	We know one bomber is roughly 1/4th of the price of a mine, so exp(bomber) maybe? Well if we choose a general number,
   	then Exp(lvl) = 10^11, something outrageous. So that can't really work. Linear bombers, possibly...
   	One thing we could do is do this numerically...I mean, what we could do is try values that solve the equation starting from one
   	and incrementing in units of five or so until a "correct" answer is found...it'd mean something like 600 calculations per bombing run
   	though.
   	
   	Combination it: Record values up till level 30 and then beyond level 30, extrapolate...make it start at level 30's number
   	and do increases in units of five until it gets close to the number. Agrizzled.
   	
   	
   How about this? Below the set number, the probability that a bombing will knock down a building level is proportional
   to Exp(-setnumber/number)/Exp(-1) for the probability that it breaks down the level. Then, above a certain point,
   the probability is 100% guaranteed to succeed...but I feel like, no matter what, something amazing needs to be able to happen.
   
   but it needs to be amazing. There needs to be room for fantastic survival in this engine. There needs to be a second modifier,
   the Omega modifier, that only activates above
   the 100% limit(setnumber<number) and if it's between 0-Exp[setnumber/numberofbombers]/(100*Exp[1]), we get that the bombing
   fails. So it's 1% at the equality limit, that it'll fail...but this only activating above the limit sort of means that below
   the limit, it better work out: at one below, there is a 1% chance of failure, and one above, 1% chance of failure. So the two
   solutions meet at the center. This is what we want.
   
   So final:
   
   For <setnumber, Exp(-setnumber/number)/Exp(-1)
   For >setnumber, Exp[setnumber/numberofbombers]/(100*Exp[1])
   
   Create random numbers that should be between 0-1 and test against this. How to find which level to bomb?
   
   Check target and find type match, then search for those buildings - find the number, create an array, measure the bombing success on each one,
   then take down the level of the highest level lost.
   
   In all of this we forgot to include the truly magical world of civilian bombing. In this case, we can use the same idea
   as building levels...actually, why not make the ability to kill the civvies proportional to the level of the building?
   No, because then sending bombers without bldg-blasting capability is a high resistance job...we could make it
   so that by lowering the building level, it kills civvies, but no. Since bombers scale exactly like civilians,
   we can just look at the base prices and compare those, since they will both have slope increases of the same rate.
   
   If you have ten bombers, the tenth bomber is going to be ten x the base price, and the tenth civilian, ten x the base
   price, so if you get 1600*10 = 16000 and 100*10 = 1000, then the civilian is still going to be 1/16th the price,
   so that the tenth bomber should kill 16 civilians. But civilians cost 80, actually, so just take bombers
   and do a division of 16/.8 = 20 civilians per bomber, roughly. Then keep this as an accumulator and subtract
   from it as you look at each bldg().
   
 	How about a limit proportional to
   
   Exp[bomberpeoplepointsleft/totalbomberpeoplepoints]/Exp[1]?
   
   and use a random number for each building to see if it gets hit?
   
   Then, in the first building hit, there is a 100% that we can empty the building on people points.
   And then we move on down, as we subtract bomber people points, the chance gets less that the building
   will take a heavy hit...and so buildings with few pop that get killed will not really effect
   the limit. Then there are always chances of less death. Of miracles - happening.
   Because to miss an entire building happens - whether or not it is highly full. And there may
   be not enough bombers to get at it.
   
Price of Bombers?

Note that setting 1600 as the price for the unit effectively is arbitrary. It really only determines the number of them
required to take down a bldg level. Their population should be adjusted for how many soldiers they kill, but they won't
kill many, and so we can set that arbitrarily too. But if they have such low stats, and incredibly crappy concealment, what
do they get? Well they get to do what other units can't, knock down buildings and stuff. That's a HUGE advantage. This also makes
them valuable and there is a need to protect them. As they are a separate unit class, apart from the rest in a way, everyone
will be in the same trouble and will need to protect them accordingly, how much so will evolve over time, and become natural.
Only further experimentation is possible.

Redesigning the bomber?
What do I want?
I want the bomber to be a semi-viable attack unit, with about the defensive and offensive capabilities of a tank.
I want the bomber to only be able to carry a bomb weapon.
I want the bomber to be half as concealable as the tank but in return get 2x the expmod.
	-This means that they can get an easier exponential advantage(bc flying) but less concealment.
The Bomber will be priced at 12x, as opposed to 6x, since it gets an extra mission parameters, namely bombing.

Let's use the numbers we have:

20 popSize means they receive a hell of a lot more damage(20x that of a soldier plus they are half as defensive,
totaling a 40x damage increase). They use a tier 2 weapon on average,
the same as a soldier can hold, so they do 20x the damage that a soldier does. With 4000 HP, they have 40x the HP
so the defensive issue is practically erased. So really they are an ultra powerful combat unit - 
if they do 20x the damage that a soldier does, and it takes roughly 20 soldiers to kill it, then it's
expmod should be around 20, but this should be tested. It on average has 25 for a stat, and soldiers
have roughly 100 for their attacking stat, leading to a factor of 4 x 20 x .5  x100 = 40*100 = 4000 which means in a one
on one, the twenty soldiers kill out the bomber. Which makes it's expmod exactly 20, same as it's popsize.

It will kill approximately 100/50 = a factor of 2 for weapons, so .5 * 20 * 100 * 2 = 2000 or twenty soldiers. 

So ideally, it's got 20x the price, which would normally undergo the concealment and no recon decrease of 37.5%, but this guy
does get another mission type and can bomb so it should be 20x the price straight up. Also, their weapons are not
maneuverable in any way so really the 20x is a loseout, only useful if you want to kill buildings and stuff.

 	
 
 What about price changes with growing prices and 10sold=1tank? 8x of what?
 
 If one tank is = to ten soldiers, let's look at how much ten soldiers cost - 
 
 if tanks, as you say, cost 8x, then say a soldier costs 1. Then a tank costs 8.
 
 But ten soldiers under linear cost raising costs 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55. Well, shit.
 Shouldn't it be 8x55 then? Can this idea of yours be preserved? The answer? Yes.
 Around 100 soldiers, the price is 100+101+102+103...=1055. The tank at this point, at
 100 units, is 100*8 = 800. The price of the 100th soldier is 100x. The price of the
 10th tank is 10*8*x = 80x. The price of the 1000th soldier is 1000x. The price
 of the 100th tank is 800x.  I use 1000 soldiers->100 tank because they are equivalent,
 combatively.
 
 And this is roughly 8x the price. So as numbers increase, this relation DOES indeed hold.
 
 It's just, in the beginning, it really doesn't - so people will rather build tanks
 until they get high enough, then they'll go for men, and at high enough numbers, the two
 will be about evenly where they're supposed to be!
 
 
 
 
 How powerful are civilians?
 
 Well, 80 soldiers kill 160 civilians(12121 hp lost thereabouts) and vice versa does 8100 damage(about 80 soldiers),
 so they are on average half as strong as soldiers with the same gun and distribution of talents, though they carry
 no cargo points.




 How does the new fighting system work?
 Right, so it does the fractions on the three different stats, highest frac wins.
 Damage is doled out on weighted average form - you donate your damage times the weighted fraction
 which is your pop over the rest of the armies pop, all of these are summed for a weighted average. Number is
 multiplied by 100 and .5 (.5 as a factor to moderate it, otherwise evenly matched normal guys kill each other off
 completely) and 100 is the basic unit of health. It's actually multiplied
 by the percentage of the enemy population that that component makes up. 
 
 The exponential expmod thing factor is a measure of exponential advantage. The standards are set by the fact that
 10soldiers = 1 tank, and 40 soldiers = 1 Juggernaught, so that the exp advantage is 1 (no change) when these
 matches are made.
 
 
 
 
 
 When does pop go up?
 
 Only when civilians are made, as this is tallied for concealment and including troops cancels the effect.
 Yeah. Go fuck yourself.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 How does hp work and prices?
 
 Works on the basis that a tank can kill ten men(5x pop x 2x firepower = 10x hp loss as men)
 
Exponential advantage had to be removed for symmetry. We keep population instead because it determines concealment -
without this, concealment on tanks could be much higher than for humans.

 so ten men should be able to kill one tank, hence a tank has about 5x the hp, because it has 2x as much armor,
 so 5x2 = 10, 10x the overall effectiveness. See?
 
 
 Bombers can have 20x hp, since they're valuable, costing about 2 tanks but being weak as
 shit.
  
Tanks put out five times the damage due to population, and in general have twice the firepower, so they accumulate
roughly a factor of ten better than soldiers, so to counteract this, they should cost ten times as much to use.

Juggernaughts have four times firepower and ten times damage due to population, so should cost 40x as much.

Bombers should only cost 20x as much, because they have a single weapons slot and do next to no damage.

But because soldiers get better concealment, make it more 9x or 7x, 34x, 16x, etc, so that yeah they have
more firepower but not as much concealment, and no scouting ability. See the concealment quantifier section to get a good bead on this.

But the reality is the .5 modifier makes so that generally, you put out half as much killing power as
it takes to kill you. So if you've got 10 soldiers, they can kill 5. 1 Juggernaught can kill about 25 people.
1 tank can probably kill about 5 soldiers. But to kill each of these two units, you need 40 people
and 10 people, respectively. Similarly, if you wanted to kill the 40 soldiers, you'd need 2 juggernaughts.

But what does this mean for unit pricing?

 You've got to either price by the damage done, or by how much
damage it takes to kill you. So a Jugger takes 40 soldiers to kill but kills about 20-25. Now, if you took
this .5 modifier off it'd probably got back to 40-1 and stuff like that basically you always kill exactly
what you send and you'll always do a subtraction. Unacceptable.

Well the good thing is - if we go by one or the other, everyone faces that. So let's consider the 40x
price on Juggernaughts. Yeah, you could pay it and kill 25 soldiers - meaning you pay more to kill
those soldiers. Alternatively, though, if you want to kill 25 soldiers with soldiers, you must
buy approximately 40 soldiers because of the .5 difference...that's gonna be something like
.5*100*40 = 2000 = 20 soldiers. So either way you're paying the 40x price tag to get 25.

Now if we go by how much they can kill, then you're paying 25x for a Juggernaught or 40x for
the 40 soldiers to kill the same 25 soldiers - uneven. So the prices are correct




Quantifying the loss due to concealment:
 We're fucked. The equation goes like
 
 			sigmaTermdef+=((HUdef.concealment-au.concealment)*au.size*au.popSize/(HUdef.size*HUdef.popSize));
					
		
				 sigmaTermdef = HUdef.concealment-sigmaTermdef;
			double expTerm2 = Math.exp(-(currentArmySizeDefPop+1)/((sigmaTermdef+1)*(holdAttack.town2.getPop()+1)*Math.exp(holdAttack.town2.getStealth())));
				
 This is where we stand. Okay so tanks take AWAY from concealment half as much as 10 soldiers would.
 They also get 5/2 = 2.something in the expterm whereas the 10/1 doesn't... and by size, it's 1/2,
 which Exp[-10] is much worse than Exp[-.5]. By expmod, it's Exp[-5] vs Exp[-10], either way
 soldiers are gettin screwed. What if we...modded the equations a bit. We don't want concealment
 to hurt having tanks and juggers, so we make it that we use their expmod and halve their
 contribution to concealment if they're a tank and fourth if it it's a jugger.
 
 Then it'd be 10/1 and 10/1. Or 40/1 and 40/1.
 
 Different formula. Say x is soldier concealment. If we did
 
 popSize/x, then tanks get 5/2, jugger 40/4, and bomber 20/.5=10. Bombers interestingly
 are the same. If we do expMod/x, then we get 10/1, 10/2, and 40/1,40/4 and 20/1,20/.5.
 
We want 5x harder to conceal, 10x harder, 20x harder, respectively. Then this reflects
the fact that they detract 5x more, 10x more, and so on from concealment.

So we can get that five up there by using popSize. The problem is 10 soldiers
are 1 tank, so the 10soldiers = 10 pop, the 1 tank is 5. So we switch
to expmod then. The problem is tanks are twice as good, juggers four times, at concealments. What we need are to get rid of these.
So we just do expMod/(concealment/2 or 4 or .5 to cancel out the differences) gets me back to zero.
Then to make tanks 5x harder to conceal, we multiply this equation by 5, or 10, or 20 if jugger or bomber also.

How do we apply this? By first using the expmods, sure, but the concealment is generated by the HU and differences.
So we need a new thing. So we change the sigmaTerm to go by ((moddedhigh-moddedcurrent)*au.size/(total size.)
and we mod them as we grab them. This also means tanks and juggers, which can support more powerful weapons,
will naturally go for anti-concealment, because they're a hell of a lot easier to hit.] Since the
modded concealments already contain information about the population sizes of these units, or rather
the detriments due to these units, we just need to worry about their proportion of size as opposed to
others. So 10 soldiers contribute as much as 10 tanks, because the 10tanks already have their concealments
modded by a factor of 2, to get 10/1 and 10/1, they add equally to the sum.

Instead of 5, 10 or 20 we do 2x, 4x, or .5x on the fucking fraction itself from below:

BUT WAAAAIIIITTT: if we do (samexpmodeitherway)/(sameconcealmenteitherway) * 2, then tanks
get that shit. so tanks get divided by 2 once because they have 2x the concealment,
and then once again because they need to be 2x harder to hide. First we equalize,
then we make it harder for juggers and stuff. How do we implement this? 
by when adding a variable that does it for us called moddedExpMod or something.

so okay if you send x number of tanks you get x resources and you get x power in x time
4:12 PM
 
to get the same concealment
4:12 PM
 
you send 2x soldiers and you get 2x resources and you get 1.8x power in 2x time
Noah J. Prince
4:12 PM
why 1.8
Jiggly Yo Wigly
4:12 PM
accounting for tier 2 weapons being 110% power of tier 1
4:12 PM
 
however you keep in mind that 2x soldiers cost in the long run 2x as much
Noah J. Prince
4:12 PM
so tanks are more powerful
Jiggly Yo Wigly
4:13 PM
so okay if you send x number of tanks you get x resources and you get x power in x time for x resources to build
4:12 PM

to get the same concealment
4:12 PM

you send 2x soldiers and you get 2x resources and you get 1.8x power in 2x time for 2x resources to build
Noah J. Prince
4:13 PM
but i guess it makes up because you can have more of them
Jiggly Yo Wigly
4:13 PM
I modified my previous statement
4:13 PM
 
so I think we can cancel out the 2x power part
4:13 PM
 
because you pay for the power by buying the units
4:13 PM
 
right
Noah J. Prince
4:14 PM
sure
Jiggly Yo Wigly
4:14 PM
so then what's left is you get 2x resources for 2x time
4:14 PM
 
or x resources for x time
4:14 PM
 
that's what's called a balance
Noah J. Prince
4:14 PM
and your whats called a faggot
Jiggly Yo Wigly
4:14 PM
with there of course being a wait of .2x less power in the soldiers due to the fact that you max out their build reduction due to engineers earlier in the game
Noah J. Prince
4:15 PM
program that shit and update it asap
4:15 PM
 
so i can pwn thornes bitch ass
 
One tank's cargo is like 2x soldiers, but 10x soldiers = tank combat wise. So? Well
tank has 5x population and this gets multiplied by the 2x to = 10x. Similarly,
Jugger has 4x and has 10 people, so it gets 40x. So Cargo is all the same.

But what of the fact that soldiers get less speed? In terms of armor, it does not matter,
they're supposed to be weaker - tanks and juggers lose out on concealment and get
compensated, and in cargo they are equal, but in speed there is an imbalance.
Tanks are on average 2x faster and Juggers are 4x faster. Well, if you make it
so that Juggers get 1/4th as many res as a soldier in cargo, and tanks 1/2 as much,
then a tank can raid 2x faster but only grabs 1/2 as much.

So how do we solve this monstrously unfair equation? So we know that tanks
can make a factor of 2 more raids than soldiers, and juggers a factor of 4.
Should they cost more due to this? Well clearly. 3

 
By 35x, we mean they cost as much as it takes to build 35 soldiers, which is different than 35*price_of_one_soldier.
Then they are on the exact same scaleup of price as the soldier is...
 So I changed prices of units so that the multiplier for a Jugger was not just 35,
which is 35*the base price of a soldier, but actually the price of building 35 soldiers.
i.e. it takes into account the fact that each of the 35 increases in price by making the
multiplier be 35*(35+1)/2 so that when it hits the base price, it ups it to 35 soldiers worth,
then the factor that is determined by how many of those units are in existence is multiplied on this
quantity to give the price of the new Juggernaught, bitch!

Now really it does make sense to have tanks and juggers, they cost exactly what you'd expect, finally.

 Continuing on my track, Do we need to worry about tanks v juggernaughts?
 
 Not really...I suppose they'll have to be worried about, though.
 Consider that to cancel out the exp factors, the tanks with expmods of 10 will need four to cancel out the one juggernaught,
 
 And, as expected, the test yields 4 Tanks = 1 Juggernaught, fucking awesome. However, Juggernaughts give twice the pop that Tanks do,
 but we've got to keep that. But why build Tanks if one Jug takes four out with half the pop-cost?
 This needs to be accounted for...but the price has already been adjusted for soldiers relatively and you can't change
 stats up, so something else needs to be altered.  However Juggernaughts get twice as much "Attention" in multi-component battles as tanks do.
 So yeah, Juggernaughts are half the population(so easier concealment) than four tanks, but they get twice the combative attention
 due to the weighted fraction, so that evens out there. If you want concealment, go for a Jugger, but it'll take a lot more damage,
 even though it has the same HP as the four tanks. WOOH! I think. Best to just field test it.





 How does Genocide work?
 
 What the fuck. Okay, at the beginning of attack server, any new civilians are added if allClear is on.
 Also, if there are no defensive combat units and genocide is on but there is no allClear then civilian
 units are added before the thing runs it route, so the first attack is genocide.(i.e. allClear being the boolean
 used to indicate a battle was fought and now all defensive units are dead and civvies are engaged now, so if it's off with no
 combat units, this is the first run and there is no defense) 
 
 At the end, if no resFlag has been thrown(i.e. no standoffs) and Genocide is on, then it does some tests:
 
 If number of units defending is > 0 and allClear is false, then it sends it back for another raid
 If number of units are = 0 and not all Clear, then civilians fight
 If number of units > 0 and allClear is true, then civilians go for another run around...
 if number of units = 0 and all Clear is true, then civvies are dead, and resources should be collected.
 
 This is the general idea, that you can find strewn in if-else statements at the end. I do not believe it alters much.
 

 
 
 
 
  * Delays, Synchronizer:
 * 
 *There will be a timed delay between the server's player and our own. This needs to be rectified.
 *The time it takes to set up the player object(to "synchronize") needs to be taken into account - if it
 *takes 2s, then the player object, once set up, needs to increment itself by two seconds. Or we can
 *just forget about it.
 *
 *Back to our previous example, if this started at 3:00:00, server time, then this will always be
 *3:00:02 our time, if there is always a lag of some sort. This lag will be different for everyone.
 *
 *What we need then is a clock from the server...no, we need to correct for delays, and during those delays, it'd
 *probably be good of we used a player buffer.
 *

 How does the new compile script work?
 1. User presses button, mouse adapter calls the compileScript method on BattlehardViewer,
 and sets up the lookIfCompiled timer. checkCompiler is set equal to true, practically freezing the program.
 2. compileScript loads instructions onto db.
 3. Synchronizer receives output and calls the showCompileOutput method, which shows debug screen
 if it's up with text and sets up the red C symbol and corresponding timer if it did go over the limit.
 If synchronizer never receives output within the 7s, then Synchronizer calls showCompileOutput with an error string thing
 and turns off checkCompiler. This is all contained in a single if statement.
 
 
 
 
 
 How does synchronization work?
 When loadplayerup is called, a buffered player is loaded with info. Then, synchronize on p is set
 to true. When a drawing function is called by the applet, the drawing function checks p's synchronize,
 and if it is true, it moves the values of buffered player over to p, and then continues on. Also, p's
 thread quits incrementation during the synchronize is true phase.
 
 
 
 
 
 Why not make units proportional to weaponry?
 You pay for weaponry with the amount that you can put on - one tier 2 is a little over twice as powerful
 as the equivalent tier 1, but it comes at the cost of 2 slots instead of 1. So a unit can hold 3
 different tier 1s for instance to attack three different attributes or it can be more powerful against
 2 attributes by equipping 1 tier 2 and 1 tier 1, making it stronger against 1. So this is how it pays.
 
 
 
 
 
 How do you make building deconstruct time?
 Idea would be to take as long to deconstruct as to construct, but we know that is bull.
 How about something more interesting. Newer improvements are harder to destroy. Older ones aren't.
 Why don't we just do something equivalent to lvl up but instead lvl down. Set deconstruct = true and
 then "level up" the building, except when it gets to the top tick, it gets killed.
 
 What about resource returns? There shouldn't be much - all the leveling would yield a flood. Perhaps none at all
 for now and we'll see how it goes.
 
 
 
 
 
 How do you make the buttons freeze when you click something that needs to make a server-call?
 
Right so if a button is pressed, then it turns on compilePressed and a timer, then the adapter gets locked up,
and BHViewWatch checks the output channel every second as long as compilePressed is on, or before the timer runs out, whichever
is first.

Then BHViewWatch constantly reads the output channel, and if it sees output:, it calls up the show compile script,
if it's true, it just releases the buttonPressed argument.





 Why does appletviewer crash?
 
 It may be because you mixed Panels with Swing components(J-stuff.)
 
 
 
 
 
 How does the multi-lvling of buildings work?
 
 The user calls for a second level up of a building. Then the cost is adjusted for lvlUps in the exponential, and
 if lvlUps is 0, nothing bad happens there.
 The town's level up is called, it subtracts the resources(Correctly) and if the lvlUp is 0, we
 enact the start timer and add it to the bldgserver, if not, we simply increment levelups.
 When the building server sees a building change level, it decreases lvlUps, and if it's 0, then
 the building is removed. If it does not, then the building's levelUp is called since the price
 has already been paid in advance and the clock goes ticking again.






 How are buildings loaded?
 		// The way buildings work is that they are first made and then put in via the loadBuilding method. This way,
					// all engineers and stuff like that is slowly built up.
					// Then, when a player is made and it calls the add player method on all towns, all towns set up their
					// player's stuff and also reconfigure all buildings' various ticks cycles to account for engineers that
					// may have been found after that particular building has been loaded.
					 *

How do I slow down resource rates?
Keep your integers...make an intermediary double that gets added to from resInc, when it goes over 1, all above 1 in that
buffer is put into the resources, and so it continues.





What are the rates of increase?
Resource Increases should rise like (level+1)^2 on the original rate, which'd be 20.


The idea is that one level up of your mines greatly increases your resource collection rate, and that rate
can sustain the continual purchase of troops over time up until the number of troops is of the order of (lvl+1)^2, then
one needs to become frugal once more. Unit base price should be around 20 resources also so that all the math works out.

Formula is (lvl+1)^(2+.03*(lvl+1))*100.
Run Plot[(l+1)^(2+.03*(l+1))*100/((20*(l+1)^2)), {l,0,30}] to see the characteristic times in mathematica.


    100 is the resource, not another multiplier - so actually is cost!

Building levels work like mines with the exact same formula. This is because
Caps need to be around the size of the number of people that it'll take for the user to want to upgrade their mines - i.e.,
when number^2+n = 60*(minelvl+1)^2 roughly...this is because otherwise we'll have people not being able to build units beyond caps
so they'll hit up their buildings till the buildings become too expensive, then upgrade their mines to make more bldg levels,
but then civvy units will be worth nothing relatively...so the caps need to rise like the number of units it's economical
to build. Why do the rate start at 20? See second paragraph below.

These resources can be seen as one resource, so metal starts at 20, each mine roughly costs 100 100 100 100 but
you must be careful to not go above or below too much - and if you do, that other mines take up the slack with increases.

Specifically, each unit's element price is about 20 per unit, so it's
20*n*(n+1)/2 = 10*n*(n+1) = 60(lvl+1)^2, solving for n gives the cap at a building lvl, we want
bldg lvls to rise like mine lvls, so we say minelvl=bldglvl and use bldglvl in the equation
to find the n at which people will upgrade mines and set it as a building cap so people will
upgrade buildings too. So n^2+n = 6(lvl+1)^2, c = -6(lvl+1)^2

n^2+n-c, n = -1/2 + sqrt(1+24(lvl+1)^2)/2; Best to drop the ones to get
n = sqrt(24*(lvl+1)^2)/2 = sqrt(6)*(lvl+1) = cap.

		 * entire armies around from other people without their permission or knowing is sort of
		 * like being given extra units. They could just "sell" them to people. This in itself
		 * is unacceptable. In the current way of things, users can send their own support units,

		 * 
		 * The below handles all units - it could handle it, I believe, if a user somehow managed
		 * to send support units from another player to another town, but it wouldn't calculate it entirely
		 * properly - namely, it'd assume they were all from the same user, not from different ones.
		 * However, the support() function, as defined by battlehardfunctions, does not allow
		 * moving of units that aren't your own as per the support condition, so this is a moot
		 * point.

			 * if at first you have 100 civilians in a building, with a civvyfrac of
			 * .5, then only 50 leave. Those 50 are then removed from the record and next round,
			 * civvyfrac is 1, and the 50 still do not leave the building.
			 * Right. So we are in agreement. Are we? Oh yes, we are. Hey, fuck you.
			 * Don't tell me what to fuck. :)

		 * 
		 * The equation we look for is

		 * You want to take this same proportion in your cargo. So to do this, you do...
		 * 
		 * (townResAmt/totalTownResAmt)*cargoAmt. This is the amount of that resource you WOULD take
		 * if they have more than your cargoAmt. If this amount is greater than what they have,
		 * you take all of what they have, to the bunker limit.
		 * 
		 * Then the left over, you add to overflow...
		 * 
		 * Now, you know, for instance, if they've got 80% metal, and 80% of your cargo is too much
		 * for them, then sure as hell they can't pay the rest. Think about it:
		 * they've got 70,10,10,10, and you've got Cargo for 1000. 70% of cargo is 700. They can't pay it.
		 * No way in hell. 
		 * 
		 * But 70,10,10,10 with 110 cargo is 77, you could overflow that with 7, then you take 11 and 11 and 11 from
		 * the other guys correspondingly, but they still can't pay that shit. So you have to take it all. Every time.
